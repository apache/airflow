# Per-user configuration for apache-steward

This file is committed in the adopter repo and holds preferences
that vary per developer (GitHub handle, local clone paths, optional
tool backends). It is **not** project-specific — those facts live in
`<project-config>/project.md`. Fill in the fields that apply to your
setup; the skills skip any block that is missing or marked `TODO`.

## `role_flags`

- `pmc_member: TODO` — set to `true` if you are a PMC member of the
  adopting project. Used by `security-cve-allocate` to decide whether
  you can submit the CVE allocation form directly or need to relay
  the request to a PMC member.

## `environment`

- `upstream_clone: TODO` — absolute path to your local clone of the
  public `<upstream>` repo. Used by `security-issue-fix` when it
  writes changes and opens PRs. The skill validates that the clone
  has a remote pointing at your fork before proceeding.
- `upstream_fork_remote: TODO` — name of the git remote that points
  at your personal fork (e.g. `fork`, `your-github-handle`). If
  omitted, the skill uses the first non-`origin` remote that looks
  like a fork. Explicitly setting this avoids ambiguity when you
  have multiple remotes.

## `tools`

### `ponymail`

- `enabled: false` — set to `true` if you have registered the
  PonyMail MCP in your Claude Code `mcpServers` block. When enabled
  and authenticated, the security skills use PonyMail as the primary
  read backend for mailing-list archive queries; Gmail remains the
  fallback for just-arrived inbound mail and the only backend for
  draft composition.
- `private_lists: []` — list of private mailing-list addresses that
  PonyMail should query (e.g. `["security@<project>.apache.org"]`).
  Only used when `enabled: true`.
