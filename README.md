[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/) (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## Project Focus

Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).

Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [Xcom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#xcoms)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work.

Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.

## Principles

- **Dynamic**: Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.
- **Extensible**: Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.
- **Elegant**: Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow using the powerful **Jinja** templating engine.
- **Scalable**: Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|                     | Main version (dev)           | Stable version (2.3.1)       |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Python              | 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10          | 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10          |
| Platform            | AMD64/ARM64(\*)              | AMD64/ARM64(\*)              |
| Kubernetes          | 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 | 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24 |
| PostgreSQL          | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14           | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14           |
| MySQL               | 5.7, 8                       | 5.7, 8                       |
| SQLite              | 3.15.0+                      | 3.15.0+                      |
| MSSQL               | 2017(\*), 2019 (\*)          | 2017(\*), 2019 (\*)          |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MySQL 5.x versions are unable to or have limitations with
running multiple schedulers -- please see the [Scheduler docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/scheduler.html).
MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Support for Python v3.10 will be available from Airflow 2.3.0. The `main` (development) branch
already supports Python 3.10.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of MacOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388) but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bullseye`.

## Getting started

[installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation.html),
[getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/index.html), or walking
through a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial.html).

> Note: If you're looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).

For more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit
the [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals).

Documentation for dependent projects like provider packages, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).

## Installing from PyPI

We publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky
because Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open, and
applications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both simultaneously. We decided to keep
our dependencies as open as possible (in `setup.py`) so users can install different versions of libraries
if needed. This means that `pip install apache-airflow` will not work from time to time or will
produce unusable Airflow installation.

To have repeatable installation, however, we keep a set of "known-to-be-working" constraint
files in the orphan `constraints-main` and `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those "known-to-be-working"
constraints files separately per major/minor Python version.
You can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify
correct Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL.


1. Installing just Airflow:

> Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported.

While it is possible to install Airflow with tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or
[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools), they do not share the same workflow as
`pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management.
Installing via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported.

If you wish to install Airflow using those tools, you should use the constraint files and convert
them to the appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires.


```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow==2.3.1' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.3.1/constraints-3.7.txt"
```

2. Installing with extras (i.e., postgres, google)

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==2.3.1' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.3.1/constraints-3.7.txt"
```

For information on installing provider packages, check
[providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).

## Official source code

Apache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project,
and our official source code releases:

- Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
- Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)
- Are cryptographically signed by the release manager
- Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the
  [Release Approval Process](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)

Following the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the
release provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools.

## Convenience packages

There are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are "convenience" methods - they are
not "official releases" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users
who do not want to build the software themselves.

Those are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow:

- [PyPI releases](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/) to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool
- [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow) to install airflow via
  `docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, etc. You can
  read more about using, customising, and extending the images in the
  [Latest docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/index.html), and
  learn details on the internals in the [IMAGES.rst](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/IMAGES.rst) document.
- [Tags in GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tags) to retrieve the git project sources that
  were used to generate official source packages via git

All those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources.
Some of those artifacts are "development" or "pre-release" ones, and they are clearly marked as such
following the ASF Policy.

## User Interface

- **DAGs**: Overview of all DAGs in your environment.

## Semantic versioning

As of Airflow 2.0.0, we support a strict [SemVer](https://semver.org/) approach for all packages released.

There are few specific rules that we agreed to that define details of versioning of the different
packages:

* **Airflow**: SemVer rules apply to core airflow only (excludes any changes to providers).
  Changing limits for versions of Airflow dependencies is not a breaking change on its own.
* **Airflow Providers**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the particular provider's code only.
  SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions for the packages are independent of the Airflow version.
  For example, `google 4.1.0` and `amazon 3.0.3` providers can happily be installed
  with `Airflow 2.1.2`. If there are limits of cross-dependencies between providers and Airflow packages,
  they are present in providers as `install_requires` limitations. We aim to keep backwards
  compatibility of providers with all previously released Airflow 2 versions but
  there will sometimes be breaking changes that might make some, or all
  providers, have minimum Airflow version specified. Change of that minimum supported Airflow version
  is a breaking change for provider because installing the new provider might automatically
  upgrade Airflow (which might be an undesired side effect of upgrading provider).
* **Airflow Helm Chart**: SemVer rules apply to changes in the chart only. SemVer MAJOR and MINOR
  versions for the chart are independent from the Airflow version. We aim to keep backwards
  compatibility of the Helm Chart with all released Airflow 2 versions, but some new features might
  only work starting from specific Airflow releases. We might however limit the Helm
  Chart to depend on minimal Airflow version.
* **Airflow API clients**: SemVer MAJOR and MINOR versions follow MAJOR and MINOR versions of Airflow.
  The first MAJOR or MINOR X.Y.0 release of Airflow should always be followed by X.Y.0 release of
  all clients. The clients then can release their own PATCH releases with bugfixes,
  independently of Airflow PATCH releases.

## Version Life Cycle

Apache Airflow version life cycle:

<!-- This table is automatically updated by pre-commit scripts/ci/pre_commit/pre_commit_supported_versions.py -->
<!-- Beginning of auto-generated table -->

| Version   | Current Patch/Minor   | State     | First Release   | Limited Support   | EOL/Terminated   |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2         | 2.3.1                 | Supported | Dec 17, 2020    | TBD               | TBD              |
| 1.10      | 1.10.15               | EOL       | Aug 27, 2018    | Dec 17, 2020      | June 17, 2021    |
| 1.9       | 1.9.0                 | EOL       | Jan 03, 2018    | Aug 27, 2018      | Aug 27, 2018     |
| 1.8       | 1.8.2                 | EOL       | Mar 19, 2017    | Jan 03, 2018      | Jan 03, 2018     |
| 1.7       | 1.7.1.2               | EOL       | Mar 28, 2016    | Mar 19, 2017      | Mar 19, 2017     |

<!-- End of auto-generated table -->

Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.
We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions

As of Airflow 2.0, we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support.
They are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the
[Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and
[Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).

1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. Except for kubernetes, a
   version stay supported by Airflow if two major cloud provider still provide support for it. We drop
   support for those EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release
   the first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow. For example, for Python 3.7 it
   means that we will drop support in main right after 27.06.2023, and the first MAJOR or MINOR version of
   Airflow released after will not have it.

2. The "oldest" supported version of Python/Kubernetes is the default one until we decide to switch to
   later version. "Default" is only meaningful in terms of "smoke tests" in CI PRs, which are run using this
   default version and the default reference image available. Currently `apache/airflow:latest`
   and `apache/airflow:2.3.1` images are Python 3.7 images. This means that default reference image will
   become the default at the time when we start preparing for dropping 3.7 support which is few months
   before the end of life for Python 3.7.

3. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we
   make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with
   new versions of Python mostly) we release new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.

## Base OS support for reference Airflow images

The Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever
we publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:

* Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)
* Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of
  Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)
* Libraries required to connect to suppoerted Databases (again the set of databases supported depends
  on the MINOR version of Airflow.
* Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)).
* Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers
  and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))
* In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed

The version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active
stable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for
building and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-life of a previous stable
version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported version of the OS.
For example since Debian Buster end-of-life is August 2022, Airflow switches the images in `main` branch
to use Debian Bullseye in February/March 2022. The version will be used in the next MINOR release after
the switch happens. In case of the Bullseye switch - 2.3.0 version will use Bullseye. The images released
in the previous MINOR version continue to use the version that all other releases for the MINOR version
used.

Users will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of life and
building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests are executed using this image in
the `main` branch.

## Approach to dependencies of Airflow

Airflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application,
therefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application,
but also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop DAGs. We developed
the approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while
we do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound
version of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is
needed because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency.
We also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.

The constraint mechanism of ours takes care about finding and upgrading all the non-upper bound dependencies
automatically (providing that all the tests pass). Our `main` build failures will indicate in case there
are versions of dependencies that break our tests - indicating that we should either upper-bind them or
that we should fix our code/tests to account for the upstream changes from those dependencies.

Whenever we upper-bound such a dependency, we should always comment why we are doing it - i.e. we should have
a good reason why dependency is upper-bound. And we should also mention what is the condition to remove the
binding.

### Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core

Those `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `setup.cfg`.

There are few dependencies that we decided are important enough to upper-bound them by default, as they are
known to follow predictable versioning scheme, and we know that new versions of those are very likely to
bring breaking changes. We commit to regularly review and attempt to upgrade to the newer versions of
the dependencies as they are released, but this is manual process.

The important dependencies are:

* `SQLAlchemy`: upper-bound to specific MINOR version (SQLAlchemy is known to remove deprecations and
   introduce breaking changes especially that support for different Databases varies and changes at
   various speed (example: SQLAlchemy 1.4 broke MSSQL integration for Airflow)
* `Alembic`: it is important to handle our migrations in predictable and performant way. It is developed
   together with SQLAlchemy. Our experience with Alembic is that it very stable in MINOR version
* `Flask`: We are using Flask as the back-bone of our web UI and API. We know major version of Flask
   are very likely to introduce breaking changes across those so limiting it to MAJOR version makes sense
* `werkzeug`: the library is known to cause problems in new versions. It is tightly coupled with Flask
   libraries, and we should update them together
* `celery`: Celery is crucial component of Airflow as it used for CeleryExecutor (and similar). Celery
   [follows SemVer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/contributing.html?highlight=semver#versions), so
   we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also when we bump the upper version of the library,
   we should make sure Celery Provider minimum Airflow version is updated).
* `kubernetes`: Kubernetes is a crucial component of Airflow as it is used for the KubernetesExecutor
   (and similar). Kubernetes Python library [follows SemVer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility),
   so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also when we bump the upper version of the library,
   we should make sure Kubernetes Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.

### Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras

Those `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `setup.py`.

By default, we should not upper-bound dependencies for providers, however each provider's maintainer
might decide to add additional limits (and justify them with comment)

## Support for providers

Providers released by the community have limitation of a minimum supported version of Airflow. The minimum
version of Airflow is the `MINOR` version (2.1, 2.2 etc.) indicating that the providers might use features
that appeared in this release. The default support timespan for the minimum version of Airflow
(there could be justified exceptions) is that we increase the minimum Airflow version, when 12 months passed
since the first release for the MINOR version of Airflow.

For example this means that by default we upgrade the minimum version of Airflow supported by providers
to 2.2.0 in the first Provider's release after 21st of May 2022 (21st of May 2021 is the date when the
first `PATCHLEVEL` of 2.1 (2.1.0) has been released.
