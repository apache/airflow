Small tool to update status of all AIP-47 issues.

Simply:

1) Activate dev environment based on [requirements](dev/requirements.txt)

2) Set GITHUB_TOKEN to repo-writeable token

3) Run this:

```bash
python dev/system_tests/update_issue_status.py
```


It will automatically update status of all the AIP-47 issues based on the presence of files in the repo.

You can also run it with ``--dry-run`` mode - useful when you have no write permission to the repository.
You can generate a read-only token (or hope you will not hit rate limits if you do not have one)
In this case it will only show what would have happened if you had  the access and print stats.
