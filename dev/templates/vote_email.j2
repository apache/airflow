Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache {{ project_name }} {{ version }} based on {{ version_rc }}

Hello {{ project_name }} Community,

This is a call for the vote to release Apache {{ project_name }} version {{ version }}.

The release candidate:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/{{ project_module }}/{{ version_rc }}/

*apache-airflow-{{ version_rc }}-source.tar.gz* is a source release that comes
with INSTALL instructions.
*apache-airflow-{{ version_rc }}-bin.tar.gz* is the binary Python "sdist" release.

Public keys are available at: https://www.apache.org/dist/{{ project_module }}/KEYS

The Change Log for the release:
https://github.com/apache/{{ project_module }}/blob/{{ version_rc }}/CHANGELOG.md

The vote will be open for at least 72 hours or until the necessary number
of votes are reached.

Please vote accordingly:

[ ] +1 approve
[ ] +0 no opinion
[ ] -1 disapprove with the reason

Only votes from PMC members are binding, but members of the community are
encouraged to test the release and vote with "(non-binding)".

Please note that the version number excludes the `rcX` string, so it's now
simply {{ version }}. This will allow us to rename the artifact without modifying
the artifact checksums when we actually release.

Thanks,
{{ release_manager }}
