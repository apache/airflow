# Purpose of the document

This document contains explanation of a few manual procedures we might use at certain times, to update
our CI and constraints manually when the automation of our CI is not enough. There are some edge cases
and events that might trigger the need of refreshing the information stored in our GitHub Repository.

We are storing two things in our GitHub Registry that are needed for both our contributors
and users:

* `CI and PROD image cache` - used by our CI jobs to speed up building of images while CI jobs are running
* `Constraints files` - used by both, CI jobs (to fix the versions of dependencies used by CI jobs in regular
  PRs) and used by our users to reproducibly install released airflow versions.

Normally, both are updated and refreshed automatically via [CI system](../CI.rst). However, there are some
cases where we need to update them manually. This document describes how to do it.

# Automated image cache and constraints refreshing in CI

Our [CI system](../CI.rst) is build in the way that it self-maintains. Regular scheduled builds and
merges to `main` branch builds (also known as `canary` builds) have separate maintenance step that
take care about refreshing the cache that is used to speed up our builds and to speed up
rebuilding of [Breeze](../BREEZE.rst) images for development purpose. This is all happening automatically, usually:

* The latest [constraints](../CONTRIBUTING.rst#pinned-constraint-files) are pushed to appropriate branch after all tests succeed in the
  `canary` build.

* The [images](../IMAGES.rst) in `ghcr.io` registry are refreshed early at the beginning of the `canary` build. This
  is done twice during the canary build:
   * By the `Push Early Image Cache` job that is run at the beginning of the `canary` build. This cover the
     case when there are new dependencies added or Dockerfile/scripts change. Thanks to that step, subsequent
     PRs will be faster when they use the new Dockerfile/script. Those jobs **might fail** occasionally,
     if the latest PR added some conflicting dependencies with current constraints. This is not a problem
     and when it happens, it will be fixed by the next step.
   * By the `Push Image Cache` job that is run at the end of the `canary` build. This covers the case when
     cache is also refreshed after than `main` build succeeds after the new constraints are pushed. This
     step makes sure that constraints are committed and pushed just before the cache is refreshed, so
     there is no problem with conflicting dependencies.

# Manually refreshing the image cache

## Why we need to update image cache manually

Sometimes, when we have a problem with our CI running and flakiness of GitHub Actions runners or our
tests, the refresh might not be triggered. This has been mitigated by "Push Early Image Cache" job added in
our CI, but there are other reasons you might want to refresh the cache. Sometimes we want to refresh the
image cache in `vX_Y_test` branch (following our convention of branch names `vX_Y_test` branch is the branch
used to release all `X.Y.*` versions of airflow) before we attempt to push a change there.
There are no PRs happening in this branch, so manual refresh before we make a PR might speed up the PR build.
Or sometimes we just refreshed the constraints (see below) and we want the cache to include those.

## Prerequisites

Note that in order to refresh images you have to not only have `buildx` command installed for docker,
but you should also make sure that you have the buildkit builder configured and set. Since we also build
multi-platform images (for both AMD and ARM), you need to have support for qemu or hardware ARM/AMD builders
configured. The chapters below explain both options.

### Setting up cache refreshing with emulation

According to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/#build-multi-platform-images)
this can be achieved via:

```bash
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```

More information can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_create/)

However, emulation is very slow - more than 10x slower than hardware-backed builds.

### Setting up cache refreshing with hardware ARM/AMD support

If you plan to build  a number of images, probably better solution is to set up a hardware remote builder
for your ARM or AMD builds (depending which platform you build images on - the "other" platform should be
remote.

This  can be achieved by settings build as described in
[this guideline](https://www.docker.com/blog/speed-up-building-with-docker-buildx-and-graviton2-ec2/) and
adding it to docker buildx `airflow_cache` builder.

This usually can be done with those two commands:

```bash
docker buildx create --name airflow_cache   # your local builder
docker buildx create --name airflow_cache --append HOST:PORT  # your remote builder
```

One of the ways to have HOST:PORT is to login to the remote machine via SSH and forward the port to
the docker engine running on the remote machine.

When everything is fine you should see both local and remote builder configured and reporting status:

```bash
docker buildx ls

  airflow_cache          docker-container
       airflow_cache0    unix:///var/run/docker.sock
       airflow_cache1    tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
```

## How to refresh the image cache

The images can be rebuilt and refreshed after the constraints are pushed. Refreshing image for all
python version is as simple as running the [refresh_images.sh](refresh_images.sh) script which will
rebuild all the images in parallel and push them to the registry.

Note that you need to run `docker login ghcr.io` before you run the script and you need to be
a committer in order to be able to push the cache to the registry.

```bash
./dev/refresh_images.sh
```

## Is it safe to refresh the image cache?

Yes. Image cache is only used to speed up the build process in CI. The worst thing that can happen if
the image cache is broken is that the PR builds of our will run slower - usually, for regular PRs building
the images from scratch takes about 15 minutes. With the image cache it takes about 1 minute if there are no
dependency changes. So if the image cache is broken, the worst thing that will happen is that the PR builds
will run longer "Wait for CI Image" step and "Wait for PROD image" will simply wait a bit longer.

Eventually the cache will heal itself. When the `main` build succeeds with all the tests, the cache is
automatically updated. Actually it's even faster in new CI process of ours, the cache is refreshed
very quickly after there is a merge of a new PR to the main ("Push Early Image Cache" jobs), so
cache refreshing and self-healing should be generally rather quick.

## What the command does

The command does the following:

* builds the CI image using the builders configured using buildx and pushes the cache
  to the `apache/airflow` registry (`--prepare-buildx-cache` flag). It builds all images in parallel for
  both AMD and ARM architectures.
* prepares packages and airflow packages in `dist` folder using the latest sources
* moves the packages to the `docker-context-files` folder so that they are available when building the
  PROD images
* builds the PROD image using the builders configured and packages prepared using buildx and pushes the cache
  to the `apache/airflow` registry (`--prepare-buildx-cache` flag). It builds all images in parallel for
  both AMD and ARM architectures.

# Manually generating constraint files

## Why we need to generate constraint files manually

Sometimes we want to generate constraint files if - for whatever reason - we cannot or do not want to wait
until `main` or `vY_Z_test` branch tests succeed. The constraints are only refreshed by CI when all the tests
pass, and this is a good thing, however there are some cases where we cannot solve some intermittent problem
with tests, but we KNOW that the tip of the branch is good and we want to release a new airflow version or
we want to move the PRs of contributors to start using the new constraints. This should be done with caution
and you need to be sure what you are doing, but you can always do it manually if you want.

## How to generate constraint files

```bash
breeze ci-image build --run-in-parallel --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies --answer yes
breeze release-management generate-constraints --airflow-constraints-mode constraints --run-in-parallel --answer yes
breeze release-management generate-constraints --airflow-constraints-mode constraints-source-providers --run-in-parallel --answer yes
breeze release-management generate-constraints --airflow-constraints-mode constraints-no-providers --run-in-parallel --answer yes

AIRFLOW_SOURCES=$(pwd)
```

The constraints will be generated in `files/constraints-PYTHON_VERSION/constraints-*.txt` files. You need to
check out the right 'constraints-' branch in a separate repository, and then you can copy, commit and push the
generated files.

You need to be a committer, and you have to be authenticated in the apache/airflow repository for your
git commands to be able to push the new constraints

```bash
cd <AIRFLOW_WITH_CONSTRAINTS-MAIN_DIRECTORY>
git pull
cp ${AIRFLOW_SOURCES}/files/constraints-*/constraints*.txt .
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here" --no-verify
git push
```

## Is it safe to generate constraints manually?

The slight risk is that if there is a constraint problem that impacts regular PRs and tests then it might
make all PRs "red" until the constraint is fixed. However, if this is the case then usually we should fix
the problem by fixing the tests or dependencies and the automated CI process should be able to self-heal.
The main build does not use constraints and it will attempt to upgrade (or downgrade) the dependencies to
the latest version matching the dependency specification we have in setup.cfg/setup.py/provider.yaml files.
Also the constraints are pushed without `--force` so there is no risk of destroying anything.
The history is kept in Git, so you can always revert to the previous version if needed.

# Manually updating already tagged constraint files

## Why we need to update constraint files manually (very rarely)

Sometimes - very rarely - we need to fix historical constraint files when Airflow fails to install with the
constraints that were used in the past. This happened already several times and usually only happens when
there is a backwards-incompatible change in the build environment in Python installation toolchain
(pip, setuptools, wheel, Cython etc.). The Python build environment is not controllable by us - by default
pip uses `build isolation` which means that it will install the latest version of the build tools. Those
tools versions are chosen by `pip` separately for each package. However, this might mean that new versions of
such tools, released after the package has been released can break the installation. This happened for
example in July 2023 when major (3.0.0) version of Cython has been released and it
broke `pymssql` installation. We had to update the constraint files to use `pymssql==2.2.8` instead
of `pymssql==2.2.7` because version 2.2.7 did not limit but also did not work with the new version of Cython.
Version 2.2.8 of `pymssql` fixed compatibility with Cython 3.0.0, so replacing it in constraints brought back
the reproducibility of installation promised by constraints.

## How to update the constraints

Breeze has `update-constraints` command in `release-management` group that can be used to update the
constraints in bulk.

This is a step-by-step instruction on how to use it:

1. You need to have "airflow" repository checked out separately from the repository you are working on. For
   example in `/home/myuser/airflow-constraints` folder.
2. You need to checkout `constraints-main` branch in this repository. By default the command expects that
   there is a remote named "apache" pointing to the official Apache repository. You can override this
    by passing `--remote-name` option to the command.
3. You need to run `breeze release-management update-constraints` command. The `breeze` command comes usually
   from another clone of airflow repository - usually from the `main` branch. You should pass those options to
   the command:
      * path to the "constraints" repository
      * remote name where the constraints should be pushed (optionally - default "apache")
      * list of airflow versions to update constraints for
      * list of constraints to update in the form of "package==version" (you can specify it multiple times)
      * message to be used in the commit message

   Make sure you use exactly the same form of the name for the package to be updated as the one already in the
   constraints. PyPI normalizes names of packages and sometimes you can see different variants of it - for
   example `pyaml` vs. `PyYaml`. Check what is currently stored in constraints for the package you want to
   update and use exactly the same form of the package name.

4. Verify manually if the change is visible as expected by inspecting the constraints at:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/constraints-<airfow-version>

## Is it safe to update constraints manually?

The command is designed with safety in mind. Even if you make a mistake there is always a way back. But
there are a few ways you can check that what you are doing is going to work as expected. Read on.

It's a good idea to add `--dry-run` option to the command to see what will be updated before you actually
run the command.

However, even if you do not use `--dry-run` option, the command will ask you to
confirm the updates so you will have a chance to verify it before each version change.

When you run the command for the first time you can also add `--verbose` instead of `--dry-run` and
you will see the git commands being executed by the command while it is doing its job.

Airflow constraint tags are moved with ``--force`` option - this needs to be done because we are moving already
existing tag, however branches are pushed without force so there is no risk of losing history in the repository.
You can always see the history and revert the changes and restore old tags manually. Usually the "final" tags
are the same as the latest "rc*" tags for the same version so it is easy to find where the tag was
pointing before - we also print hash of the commits before attempting to make modifications so you can
always see what commit the tag has been pointing to before the command is run.

## How the command works under-the-hood ?

The command will do the following for every Airflow version specified:

  * checkout "constraints-<version>" tag
  * reset "constraints-<version>-fix" branch to the tag
  * update constraints in-place
  * commit the changes
  * tag the commit with "constraints-<version>" tag
  * push the "constraints-<version>-fix" branch with the commit to the remote selected
  * push the tag to the remote selected


## Examples of running the command

Example of updating constraints for Airflow 2.5.0 - 2.6.3 and updating `pymssql` constraint to 2.2.8:

```bash
breeze release-management update-constraints --constraints-repo /home/user/airflow-constraints \
    --airflow-versions 2.5.0,2.5.1,2.5.2,2.5.3,2.6.0,2.6.1,2.6.2,2.6.3 \
    --updated-constraint pymssql==2.2.8 \
    --commit-message "Update pymssql constraint to 2.2.8"
```

Example of updating multiple constraints:

```bash
breeze release-management update-constraints --constraints-repo /home/user/airflow-constraints \
    --airflow-versions 2.5.0,2.5.1,2.5.2,2.5.3,2.6.0,2.6.1,2.6.2,2.6.3 \
    --updated-constraint pymssql==2.2.8 \
    --updated-constraint Authlib==1.3.0 \
    --commit-message "Update pymssql constraint to 2.2.8 and Authlib to 1.3.0"
```
