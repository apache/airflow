        You can attempt to backport this manually by running:

        ```bash
        cherry_picker {commit_sha[:7]} {branch}
        ```

        This should apply the commit to the {branch} branch and leave the commit in conflict state marking
        the files that need manual conflict resolution.

        After you have resolved the conflicts, you can continue the backport process by running:

        ```bash
        cherry_picker --continue
        ```
