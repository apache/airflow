# What the provider packages are

The Provider packages are separate packages (one package per provider) that implement
integrations with external services for Airflow in the form of installable Python packages.

The Release Manager prepares packages separately from the main Airflow Release, using
`breeze` commands and accompanying scripts. This document provides an overview of the command line tools
needed to prepare the packages.

NOTE!! When you have problems with any of those commands that run inside `breeze` docker image, you
can run the command with `--debug` flag that will drop you in the shell inside the image and will
print the command that you should run.

# Provider packages

The prerequisites to release Apache Airflow are described in [README.md](README.md).

You can read more about the command line tools used to generate the packages in the
[Provider packages](PROVIDER_PACKAGE_DETAILS.md).

# Bump min Airflow version for providers

1. Update `BASE_PROVIDERS_COMPATIBILITY_CHECKS` in `src/airflow_breeze/global_constants.py` to remove
the versions of Airflow that are not applicable anymore.

2. Check if Breeze unit tests in `dev/breeze/tests/test_packages.py` need adjustments. This is done by simply
searching and replacing old version occurrences with newer one. For example 2.5.0 to 2.6.0

3. Update minimum airflow version for all packages, you should modify `MIN_AIRFLOW_VERSION`
in `src/airflow_breeze/utils/packages.py` and run the `prepare-provider-documentation`
command with the `--only-min-version-update` flag. This will only update the min version in
the `__init__.py` files and package documentation without bumping the provider versions.

```shell script
branch="update-min-airflow-version"
git checkout -b "${branch}"
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --only-min-version-update
git add .
git commit -m "Bump minimum Airflow version in providers to Airflow 2.6.0"
git push --set-upstream origin "${branch}"
```

Note: that this command will only bump the min airflow versions for those providers that do not have it set to
a higher version. You do not have to skip specific providers - run it for all providers it will
handle everything automatically.

Note: this step is **not** part of the release cycle. It should be done independently
when the time to update min airflow version has come.

# Decide when to release

You can release provider packages separately from the main Airflow on an ad-hoc basis, whenever we find that
a given provider needs to be released - due to new features or due to bug fixes.
You can release each provider package separately, but due to voting and release overhead we try to group
releases of provider packages together.

# Provider packages versioning

We are using the [SEMVER](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme for the provider packages. This is in order
to give the users confidence about maintaining backwards compatibility in the new releases of those
packages.

Details about maintaining the SEMVER version are going to be discussed and implemented in
[the related issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11425)

# Possible states of provider packages

The provider packages can be in one of several states.

* The `not-ready` state is used when the provider has some in-progress changes (usually API changes) that
  we do not  want to release yet as part of the regular release cycle. Providers in this state are excluded
  from being  released as part of the regular release cycle (including documentation building). You can build
  and prepare  such provider when you explicitly specify it as argument of a release command or by passing
  `--include-not-ready-providers` flag in corresponding command. The `not-ready` providers are treated as
  regular providers when it comes to running tests and preparing and releasing packages in `CI` - as we want
  to make sure they are properly releasable any time and we want them to contribute to dependencies and we
  want to test them. Also in case of preinstalled providers, the `not-ready` providers are contributing
  their dependencies rather than the provider package to requirements of Airflow.
* The `ready` state is the usual state of the provider that is released in the regular release cycle
  (including the documentation, package building and publishing). This is the state most providers are in.
* The `suspended` state is used when we have a good reason to suspend such provider, following the devlist
  discussion and vote or "lazy consensus". The process of suspension is described in [Provider's docs](../PROVIDERS.rst).
  The `suspended` providers are excluded from being released as part of the regular release cycle (including
  documentation building) but also they do not contribute dependencies to the CI image and their tests are
  not run in CI process. You can build and prepare such provider when you explicitly specify it as argument
  of a release command or by passing `--include-suspended-providers` flag in corresponding command (but it
  might or might not work at any time as the provider release commands are not regularly run on CI for the
  suspended providers). The `suspended` providers are not released as part of the regular release cycle.
* The `removed` state is a temporary state after the provider has been voted (or agreed in "lazy consensus")
  to be removed and it is only used for exactly one release cycle - in order to produce the final version of
  the package - identical to the previous version with the exception of the removal notice. The process
  of removal is described in [Provider's docs](../PROVIDERS.rst).  The `removed` providers are included in
  the regular release cycle (including documentation building) because the `--include-removed-providers`
  flag is passed to commands that release manager runs (see below). The difference between `suspended`
  and `removed` providers is that additional information is added to their documentation about the provider
  not being maintained any more by the community.

This graph shows the possible transitions between the states:

```

# Chicken-egg providers

Sometimes (rare) we release providers that have dependencies on future version of Airflow - which means that
they are released long before they are actually usable and it also means that versions in PyPI should be
released with `apache-airflow >= x.y.z.dev0` version, such providers should have the .dev0 suffix included
in the `apache-airflow` dependency specification, only the final release, just before the final Airflow x.y.z
release should get it changed to `>= x.y.z`. This is a rare case and should be handled with care.

We call such case chicken-egg providers as it's not clear who should be released first - the provider or
the Airflow.

# Prepare Regular Provider packages (RC)

## Increasing version number

First thing that release manager has to do is to change version of the provider to a target
version. Each provider has a `provider.yaml` file that, among others, stores information
about provider versions. When you attempt to release a provider you should update that
information based on the changes for the provider, and its `CHANGELOG.rst`. It might be that
`CHANGELOG.rst` already contains the right target version. This will be especially true if some
changes in the provider add new features (then minor version is increased) or when the changes
introduce backwards-incompatible, breaking change in the provider (then major version is
incremented). Committers, when approving and merging changes to the providers, should pay attention
that the `CHANGELOG.rst` is updated whenever anything other than bugfix is added.

If there are no new features or breaking changes, the release manager should simply increase the
patch-level version for the provider.

The new version should be first on the list.

## Generate release notes

Each of the provider packages contains Release notes in the form of the `CHANGELOG.rst` file that is
automatically generated from history of the changes and code of the provider.
They are stored in the documentation directory. The `README.md` file generated during package
preparation is not stored anywhere in the repository - it contains however link to the Changelog
generated.

When the provider package version has not been updated since the latest version, the release notes
are not generated. Release notes are only generated, when the latest version of the package does not
yet have a corresponding TAG.

The tags for providers is of the form ``providers-<PROVIDER_ID>/<VERSION>`` for example
``providers-amazon/1.0.0``. During releasing, the `rc*` tags are created (for example
``providers-amazon/1.0.0rc1``).

Details about maintaining the SEMVER version are going to be discussed and implemented in
[the related issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11425)

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation  --include-removed-providers
```

In case you prepare provider documentation for just a few selected providers, you can run:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation [packages]
```

In case you want to also release a pre-installed provider that is in ``not-ready`` state (i.e. when
you want to release it before you switch their state to ``ready``), you need to pass
``--include-not-ready-providers`` flag to the command above.

This command will not only prepare documentation but will also help the release manager to review
changes implemented in all providers, and determine which of the providers should be released. For each
provider details will be printed on what changes were implemented since the last release including
links to particular commits.

This should help to determine which version of provider should be released:

* increased patch-level for bugfix-only change
* increased minor version if new features are added
* increased major version if breaking changes are added

It also helps the release manager to update CHANGELOG.rst where high-level overview of the changes should be documented for the providers released.
You should iterate and re-generate the same content after any change as many times as you want.
The generated files should be added and committed to the repository.

When you want to regenerate the changes before the release and make sure all changelogs
are updated, run it in non-interactive mode:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --include-removed-providers --answer yes
```

In case you prepare provider documentation for just a few selected providers, you can run:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --answer yes [packages]
```

In case you want to also release a pre-installed provider that is in ``not-ready`` state (i.e. when
you want to release it before you switch their state to ``ready``), you need to pass
``--include-not-ready-providers`` flag to the command above.

NOTE!! In case you prepare provider's documentation in a branch different than main, you need to manually
specify the base branch via `--base-branch` parameter.
For example if you try to build a `cncf.kubernetes` provider that is build from `provider-cncf-kubernetes/v4-4`
branch should be prepared like this:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --include-removed-providers \
 --base-branch provider-cncf-kubernetes/v4-4 cncf.kubernetes
```

## (Optional) Apply template updates

This step should only be executed if we want to change template files for the providers - i.e. change
security information, commit/index/README content that is automatically generated.

Regenerate the documentation templates by running the command with
`--reapply-templates` flag to the command above. This refreshes the content of:

* `__init__.py` in provider's package
* Provider Commits
* Provider index for the documentation
* Provider README file used when publishing package in PyPI

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation --include-removed-providers --reapply-templates-only
```

## Open PR with suggested version releases

At this point you should have providers yaml files and changelog updated.
You should go over the change log and place changes in their relevant section (breaking change, feature, bugs, etc...)
Once finished you should raise a PR : Prepare docs for MM YYYY wave of Providers
In the PR we will verify if we want to release a specific package or if the versions chosen are right.
Only after PR is merged you should proceed to next steps.


## Build provider packages for SVN apache upload

Those packages might get promoted  to "final" packages by just renaming the files, so internally they
should keep the final version number without the rc suffix, even if they are rc1/rc2/... candidates.

They also need to be signed and have checksum files. You can generate the checksum/signature files by running
the "dev/sign.sh" script (assuming you have the right PGP key set-up for signing). The script
generates corresponding .asc and .sha512 files for each file to sign.

## Build and sign the source and convenience packages

* Cleanup dist folder:

```shell script
export AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT=$(pwd -P)
rm -rf ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*
```


* Release candidate packages:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages  --include-removed-providers --package-format both
```

if you only build few packages, run:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages  --include-removed-providers \
--package-format both PACKAGE PACKAGE ....
```

In case you want to also release a pre-installed provider that is in ``not-ready`` state (i.e. when
you want to release it before you switch their state to ``ready``), you need to pass
``--include-not-ready-providers`` flag to the command above.


* Sign all your packages

```shell script
pushd dist
../dev/sign.sh *
popd
```

## Commit the source packages to Apache SVN repo

* Push the artifacts to ASF dev dist repo

```shell script
# First clone the repo if you do not have it
cd ..
[ -d asf-dist ] || svn checkout --depth=immediates https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist asf-dist
svn update --set-depth=infinity asf-dist/dev/airflow

# Create a new folder for the release.
cd asf-dist/dev/airflow/providers

# Remove previously released providers
svn rm *

# Move the artifacts to svn folder
mv ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/* .

# Add and commit
svn add *
svn commit -m "Add artifacts for Airflow Providers $(date "+%Y-%m-%d%n")"

cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
```

Verify that the files are available at
[providers](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers/)

You should see only providers that you are about to release.
If you are seeing others there is an issue.
You can remove the redundant provider files manually with:

```shell script
svn rm file_name  // repeate that for every file
svn commit -m "delete old providers"
```

## Publish the Regular convenience package to PyPI

In order to publish release candidate to PyPI you just need to build and release packages.
The packages should however contain the rcN suffix in the version file name but not internally in the package,
so you need to use `--version-suffix-for-pypi` switch to prepare those packages.
Note that these are different packages than the ones used for SVN upload
though they should be generated from the same sources.

* Generate the packages with the rc1 version (specify the version suffix with PyPI switch). Note that
you should clean up dist folder before generating the packages, so you will only have the right packages there.

```shell script
rm -rf ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*

breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages  --include-removed-providers \
 --version-suffix-for-pypi rc1 --package-format both
```

If you only build few packages, run:

```shell script
breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages \
--version-suffix-for-pypi rc1 --package-format both PACKAGE PACKAGE ....
```

In case some packages already had rc1 suffix prepared and released, and they still need to be released, they
will have automatically appropriate rcN suffix added to them. The suffix will be increased for each release
candidate and checked if tag has been already created for that release candidate. If yes, the suffix will be
increased until the tag is not found.

* Verify the artifacts that would be uploaded:

```shell script
twine check ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*
```

* Upload the package to PyPi:

```shell script
twine upload -r pypi ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*
```

* Confirm that the packages are available under the links printed and look good.


## Add tags in git

Assume that your remote for apache repository is called `apache` you should now
set tags for the providers in the repo.

Sometimes in cases when there is a connectivity issue to Github, it might be possible that local tags get created
and lead to annoying errors. The default behaviour would be to clean such local tags up.

If you want to disable this behaviour, set the env **CLEAN_LOCAL_TAGS** to false.

```shell script
./dev/provider_packages/tag_providers.sh
```

## Prepare documentation

Documentation is an essential part of the product and should be made available to users.
In our cases, documentation  for the released versions is published in a separate repository -
[`apache/airflow-site`](https://github.com/apache/airflow-site), but the documentation source code
and build tools are available in the `apache/airflow` repository, so you have to coordinate between
the two repositories to be able to build the documentation.

Documentation for providers can be found in the `/docs/apache-airflow-providers` directory
and the `/docs/apache-airflow-providers-*/` directory. The first directory contains the package contents
lists and should be updated every time a new version of provider packages is released.

- First, copy the airflow-site repository and set the environment variable ``AIRFLOW_SITE_DIRECTORY``.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow-site.git airflow-site
cd airflow-site
export AIRFLOW_SITE_DIRECTORY="$(pwd -P)"
```

Note if this is not the first time you clone the repo make sure main branch is rebased:

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_SITE_DIRECTORY}"
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
```

- Then you can go to the directory and build the necessary documentation packages

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"
breeze build-docs --clean-build apache-airflow-providers all-providers --include-removed-providers
```

Usually when we release packages we also build documentation for the "documentation-only" packages. This
means that unless we release just few selected packages or if we need to deliberately skip some packages
we should release documentation for all provider packages and the above command is the one to use.

If we want to just release some providers you can release them using package names:

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"
breeze build-docs apache-airflow-providers cncf.kubernetes sftp --clean-build
```

- Now you can preview the documentation.

```shell script
./docs/start_doc_server.sh
```

If you encounter error like:

```shell script
airflow git:(main) ./docs/start_doc_server.sh
./docs/start_doc_server.sh: line 22: cd: /Users/eladkal/PycharmProjects/airflow/docs/_build: No such file or directory
```

That probably means that the doc folder is empty thus it can not build the doc server.
This indicates that previous step of building the docs did not work.

- Copy the documentation to the ``airflow-site`` repository

All providers (including overriding documentation for doc-only changes) - note that publishing is
way faster on multi-cpu machines when you are publishing multiple providers:


```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"

breeze release-management publish-docs apache-airflow-providers all-providers --include-removed-providers \
    --override-versioned --run-in-parallel

breeze release-management add-back-references all-providers
```

If you have providers as list of provider ids because you just released them you can build them with

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"

breeze release-management publish-docs amazon apache.beam google ....
breeze release-management add-back-references all-providers
```

Review the state of removed, suspended, new packages in
[the docs index](https://github.com/apache/airflow-site/blob/master/landing-pages/site/content/en/docs/_index.md):

- If you publish a new package, you must add it to the list of packages in the index.
- If there are changes to suspension or removal status of a package  you must move it appropriate section.

- Create the commit and push changes.

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_SITE_DIRECTORY}"
branch="add-documentation-$(date "+%Y-%m-%d%n")"
git checkout -b "${branch}"
git add .
git commit -m "Add documentation for packages - $(date "+%Y-%m-%d%n")"
git push --set-upstream origin "${branch}"
```

## Prepare issue in GitHub to keep status of testing

Create a GitHub issue with the content generated via manual execution of the command below. You will use
link to that issue in the next step.

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"

breeze release-management generate-issue-content-providers --only-available-in-dist
```

GitHub API uses rate limiting that is based on the public IP address of client if you do not authenticate
with GitHub, so when you retrieve bigger number of PRs or when you are behind NAT and share your public
IP address with many other Anonymous GitHub API users, issue retrieval will be halted and your API calls
might slow down to a crawl, you will need then a GITHUB_TOKEN set as your
environment variable or pass  the token as `--github-token` option in the script.

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"

breeze release-management generate-issue-content-providers --only-available-in-dist --github-token TOKEN
```

or

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"
export GITHUB_TOKEN=TOKEN
breeze release-management generate-issue-content-providers --only-available-in-dist
```

You can generate the token by following
[this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Read%20issues&scopes=repo:status). Since it is easy to generate such token, by following the link, it is recommended to
generate a new token for each release and delete it once you've generated the issue.

If you see in the output that some of the PRs are just "noise" (i.e. there is no need to verify them
as they are misc/documentation kind of changes that have no impact on the actual installation of
the provider or the code of the provider, can optionally pass list of PR to be excluded from
the issue with `--excluded-pr-list`. This might limit the scope of verification. Some providers
might disappear from the list and list of authors that will be pinged in the generated issue.

You can repeat that and regenerate the issue content until you are happy with the generated issue.

```shell script
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"

breeze release-management generate-issue-content-providers --only-available-in-dist --github-token TOKEN \
    --excluded-pr-list PR_NUMBER1,PR_NUMBER2
```

It's also OK to manually modify the content of such generated issue before actually creating the
issue. There is a comment generated with NOTE TO RELEASE MANAGER about this in the issue content.
Hit Preview button on "create issue" screen before creating it to verify how it will look like
for the contributors.



## Prepare voting email for Providers release candidate

Make sure the packages are in https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers/

Send out a vote to the dev@airflow.apache.org mailing list. Here you can prepare text of the
email.

subject:


```shell script
cat <<EOF
[VOTE] Airflow Providers prepared on $(date "+%B %d, %Y")
EOF
```

```shell script
cat <<EOF
Hey all,

I have just cut the new wave Airflow Providers packages. This email is calling a vote on the release,
which will last for 72 hours - which means that it will end on $(TZ=UTC date -v+3d "+%B %d, %Y %H:%M %p" ) UTC and until 3 binding +1 votes have been received.


Consider this my (binding) +1.

<ADD ANY HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES HERE!>

Airflow Providers are available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers/

*apache-airflow-providers-<PROVIDER>-*.tar.gz* are the binary
 Python "sdist" release - they are also official "sources" for the provider packages.

*apache_airflow_providers_<PROVIDER>-*.whl are the binary
 Python "wheel" release.

The test procedure for PMC members is described in
https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/README_RELEASE_PROVIDER_PACKAGES.md#verify-the-release-candidate-by-pmc-members

The test procedure for and Contributors who would like to test this RC is described in:
https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/README_RELEASE_PROVIDER_PACKAGES.md#verify-the-release-candidate-by-contributors


Public keys are available at:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS

Please vote accordingly:

[ ] +1 approve
[ ] +0 no opinion
[ ] -1 disapprove with the reason

Only votes from PMC members are binding, but members of the community are
encouraged to test the release and vote with "(non-binding)".

Please note that the version number excludes the 'rcX' string.
This will allow us to rename the artifact without modifying
the artifact checksums when we actually release.

The status of testing the providers by the community is kept here:
<TODO COPY LINK TO THE ISSUE CREATED>

The issue is also the easiest way to see important PRs included in the RC candidates.
Detailed changelog for the providers will be published in the documentation after the
RC candidates are released.

You can find the RC packages in PyPI following these links:

<PASTE TWINE UPLOAD LINKS HERE. SORT THEM BEFORE!>

Cheers,
<TODO: Your Name>

EOF
```

Due to the nature of packages, not all packages have to be released as convenience
packages in the final release. During the voting process
the voting PMCs might decide to exclude certain packages from the release if some critical
problems have been found in some packages.

Please modify the message above accordingly to clearly exclude those packages.

Note, For RC2/3 you may refer to shorten vote period as agreed in mailing list [thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/cv194w1fqqykrhswhmm54zy9gnnv6kgm).

## Verify the release candidate by PMC members

### SVN check

The files should be present in
[Airflow dist](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers/)

The following files should be present (6 files):

* .tar.gz + .asc + .sha512 (one set of files per provider)
* -py3-none-any.whl + .asc + .sha512 (one set of files per provider)

As a PMC you should be able to clone the SVN repository:

```shell script
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/
```

Or update it if you already checked it out:

```shell script
svn update .
```

Optionally you can use the [`check_files.py`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/check_files.py)
script to verify that all expected files are present in SVN. This script will produce a `Dockerfile.pmc` which
may help with verifying installation of the packages.

```shell script
# Copy the list of packages (pypi urls) into `packages.txt` then run:
python check_files.py providers -p {PATH_TO_SVN}
```

After the above script completes you can build `Dockerfile.pmc` to trigger an installation of each provider
package and verify the correct versions are installed:

```shell script
docker build -f Dockerfile.pmc --tag local/airflow .
docker run --rm --entrypoint "airflow" local/airflow info
docker image rm local/airflow
```

### Reproducible package builds checks

For provider packages we introduced a reproducible build mechanism - which means that whoever wants
to use sources of Airflow from the release tag, can reproducibly build the same "wheel" and "sdist"
packages as the release manager and they will be byte-by-byte identical, which makes them easy to
verify - if they came from the same sources. This build is only done using released dependencies
from PyPI and source code in our repository - no other binary dependencies are used during the build
process and if the packages produced are byte-by-byte identical with the one we create from tagged sources
it means that the build has a verified provenance.

How to verify it:

1) Change directory where your airflow sources are checked out

```shell
cd "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"
```

2) Check out one of the tags for the release. Pick one of the provider-specific tags that are part
   of the release wave. For example:

```shell
git checkout tags/providers-amazon-1.0.0rc1
```

3) Remove all the packages you have in dist folder

```shell
rm -rf dist/*
```

4) Build the packages using checked out sources

```shell
breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages --include-removed-providers --package-format both
```

5) Switch to the folder where you checked out the SVN dev files

```shell
cd {PATH_TO_SVN}
cd airflow/providers
```

6) Compare the packages in SVN to the ones you just built

```shell
for i in *.tar.gz *.whl
do
   echo -n "$i:"; diff $i ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/$i && echo "No diff found"
done
```

You should see output similar to:

### Licences check

This can be done with the Apache RAT tool.

* Download the latest jar from https://creadur.apache.org/rat/download_rat.cgi (unpack the binary,
  the jar is inside)
* Unpack the release source archive (the `<package + version>.tar.gz` file) to a folder
* Enter the sources folder run the check

```shell script
java -jar ../../apache-rat-0.13/apache-rat-0.13.jar -E .rat-excludes -d .
```

where `.rat-excludes` is the file in the root of Airflow source code.

### Signature check

Make sure you have imported into your GPG the PGP key of the person signing the release. You can find the valid keys in
[KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS).

You can import the whole KEYS file:

```shell script
gpg --import KEYS
```

You can also import the keys individually from a keyserver. The below one uses Kaxil's key and
retrieves it from the default GPG keyserver
[OpenPGP.org](https://keys.openpgp.org):

```shell script
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --receive-keys CDE15C6E4D3A8EC4ECF4BA4B6674E08AD7DE406F
```

You should choose to import the key when asked.

Note that by being default, the OpenPGP server tends to be overloaded often and might respond with
errors or timeouts. Many of the release managers also uploaded their keys to the
[GNUPG.net](https://keys.gnupg.net) keyserver, and you can retrieve it from there.

```shell script
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --receive-keys CDE15C6E4D3A8EC4ECF4BA4B6674E08AD7DE406F
```

Once you have the keys, the signatures can be verified by running this:

```shell script
for i in *.asc
do
   echo -e "Checking $i\n"; gpg --verify $i
done
```

This should produce results similar to the below. The "Good signature from ..." is indication
that the signatures are correct. Do not worry about the "not certified with a trusted signature"
warning. Most of the certificates used by release managers are self-signed, and that's why you get this
warning. By importing the key either from the server in the previous step or from the
[KEYS](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS) page, you know that
this is a valid key already.  To suppress the warning you may edit the key's trust level
by running `gpg --edit-key <key id> trust` and entering `5` to assign trust level `ultimate`.

### SHA512 check

Run this:

```shell script
for i in *.sha512
do
    echo "Checking $i"; shasum -a 512 `basename $i .sha512 ` | diff - $i
done
```

You should get output similar to:

```
Checking apache-airflow-providers-google-1.0.0rc1.tar.gz.sha512
Checking apache_airflow-providers-google-1.0.0rc1-py3-none-any.whl.sha512
```

## Verify the release candidate by Contributors

This can be done (and we encourage to) by any of the Contributors. In fact, it's best if the
actual users of Apache Airflow test it in their own staging/test installations. Each release candidate
is available on PyPI apart from SVN packages, so everyone should be able to install
the release candidate version.

Breeze allows you to easily install and run pre-release candidates by following simple instructions
described in
[Manually testing release candidate packages](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/testing/testing_packages.rst)

But you can use any of the installation methods you prefer (you can even install it via the binary wheels
downloaded from the SVN).

### Installing in your local virtualenv

You have to make sure you have Airflow 2* installed in your PIP virtualenv
(the version you want to install providers with).

```shell
pip install apache-airflow-providers-<provider>==<VERSION>rc<X>
```

### Installing with Breeze

```shell
breeze start-airflow --use-airflow-version 2.2.4 --python 3.8 --backend postgres \
    --load-example-dags --load-default-connections
```

After you are in Breeze:

```shell
pip install apache-airflow-providers-<provider>==<VERSION>rc<X>
```

NOTE! You should `Ctrl-C` and restart the connections to restart airflow components and make sure new
provider packages is used.

### Building your own docker image

If you prefer to build your own image, you can also use the official image and PyPI packages to test
provider packages. This is especially helpful when you want to test integrations, but you need to install
additional tools. Below is an example Dockerfile, which installs providers for Google/

```dockerfile
FROM apache/airflow:2.2.3

RUN pip install  --user apache-airflow-providers-google==2.2.2.rc1

USER ${AIRFLOW_UID}
```

To build an image build and run a shell, run:

```shell script
docker build . --tag my-image:0.0.1
docker run  -ti \
    --rm \
    -v "$PWD/data:/opt/airflow/" \
    -v "$PWD/keys/:/keys/" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -e AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES=True \
    my-image:0.0.1 bash
```

### Additional Verification

Once you install and run Airflow, you can perform any verification you see as necessary to check
that the Airflow works as you expected.


# Publish release

## Summarize the voting for the Apache Airflow release

Once the vote has been passed, you will need to send a result vote to dev@airflow.apache.org:

In both subject and message update DATE OF RELEASE, FIRST/LAST NAMES and numbers). In case
some providers were  excluded, explain why they were excluded and what is the plan for them
(otherwise remove the optional part of the message). There are two options for releasing
the next RC candidates:

* They will be released as an ad-hoc release with accelerated vote
  period on their own (when there are not many changes to other providers in the meantime and when
  we have a small bugfix for the providers that we want to release quickly.

* They will be included together with the next wave of releases (our tooling
  supports automated calculation of RC version for candidates for the next wave of releases that
  already had earlier RCs.

Email subject:

```
[RESULT][VOTE] Airflow Providers - release of DATE OF RELEASE
```

Email content:

```
Hello,

Apache Airflow Providers prepared on DATE OF RELEASE have been accepted.

3 "+1" binding votes received:
- FIRST LAST NAME (binding)
- FIRST LAST NAME (binding)
- FIRST LAST NAME (binding)

2 "+1" non-binding votes received:
- FIRST LAST NAME
- FIRST LAST NAME

[optional] The providers PROVIDER, PROVIDER have been excluded from the release.
This is due to REASON HERE.
The next RC candidates for those providers will be released [in the next wave
of providers] or [as an ad-hoc release on their own with accelerated vote period].

Vote thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/cs6mcvpn2lk9w2p4oz43t20z3fg5nl7l

I'll continue with the release process, and the release announcement will follow shortly.

Cheers,
<your name>
```

## Publish release to SVN

The best way of doing this is to svn cp  between the two repos (this avoids having to upload the binaries
again, and gives a clearer history in the svn commit logs.

We also need to archive older releases before copying the new ones
[Release policy](http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#when-to-archive)

```bash
cd "<ROOT_OF_YOUR_AIRFLOW_REPO>"
# Set AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT to the path of your git repo
export AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT="$(pwd -P)"

# Go the folder where you have checked out the release repo from SVN
# Make sure this is direct directory and a symbolic link
# Otherwise 'svn mv' errors out if it is with "E200033: Another process is blocking the working copy database
cd "<ROOT_WHERE_YOUR_ASF_DIST_IS_CREATED>"

export ASF_DIST_PARENT="$(pwd -P)"
# make sure physical path is used, in case original directory is symbolically linked
cd "${ASF_DIST_PARENT}"

# or clone it if it's not done yet
[ -d asf-dist ] || svn checkout --depth=immediates https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist asf-dist
# Update to latest version
svn update --set-depth=infinity asf-dist/dev/airflow asf-dist/release/airflow

SOURCE_DIR="${ASF_DIST_PARENT}/asf-dist/dev/airflow/providers"

# If some packages have been excluded, remove them now
# Check the packages are there (replace <provider> with the name of the provider that you remove)
ls ${SOURCE_DIR}/*<provider>*
# Remove them
svn rm ${SOURCE_DIR}/*<provider>*

# Create providers folder if it does not exist
# All latest releases are kept in this one folder without version sub-folder
cd "${ASF_DIST_PARENT}/asf-dist/release/airflow"
mkdir -pv providers
cd providers

# Copy your providers with the target name to dist directory and to SVN
rm -rf "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}"/dist/*

for file in "${SOURCE_DIR}"/*
do
 base_file=$(basename ${file})
 cp -v "${file}" "${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/${base_file//rc[0-9]/}"
 svn mv "${file}" "${base_file//rc[0-9]/}"
done

# Check which old packages will be removed using dry run
breeze release-management clean-old-provider-artifacts --directory $(pwd -P) --dry-run

# Remove those packages
breeze release-management clean-old-provider-artifacts --directory $(pwd -P)

# You need to do go to the asf-dist directory in order to commit both dev and release together
cd ${ASF_DIST_PARENT}/asf-dist
# Commit to SVN
svn commit -m "Release Airflow Providers on $(date "+%Y-%m-%d%n")"
```

Verify that the packages appear in
[providers](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/providers)

You are expected to see all latest versions of providers.
The ones you are about to release (with new version) and the ones that are not part of the current release.

Troubleshoot:
In case that while viewing the packages in dist/release you see that a provider has files from current version and release version it probably means that you wanted to exclude the new version of provider from release but didn't remove all providers files as expected in previous step.
Since you already commit to SVN you need to recover files from previous version with svn copy (svn merge will not work since you don't have copy of the file locally)
for example:

```
svn copy https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/providers/apache_airflow_providers_docker-3.4.0-py3-none-any.whl@59404
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/providers/apache_airflow_providers_docker-3.4.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Where `59404` is the revision we want to copy the file from. Then you can commit again.
You can also add  `-m "undeleted file"` to the `svn copy` to commit in 1 step.

Then remove from svn the files of the new provider version that you wanted to exclude from release.
If you had this issue you will need also to make adjustments in the next step to remove the provider from listed in twine check.
This is simply by removing the relevant files locally.


## Publish the packages to PyPI

By that time the packages should be in your dist folder.

```shell script
cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
git checkout <ONE_OF_THE_RC_TAGS_FOR_ONE_OF_THE_RELEASED_PROVIDERS>
```

example `git checkout providers-amazon/7.0.0rc2`

Note you probably will see message `You are in 'detached HEAD' state.`
This is expected, the RC tag is most likely behind the main branch.

* Verify the artifacts that would be uploaded:

```shell script
twine check ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*.whl ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*.tar.gz
```

* Upload the package to PyPi:

```shell script
twine upload -r pypi ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*.whl ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}/dist/*.tar.gz
```

* Verify that the packages are available under the links printed.

Copy links to updated packages, sort it alphabetically and save it on the side. You will need it for the announcement message.

* Again, confirm that the packages are available under the links printed.

## Publish documentation prepared before

Merge the PR that you prepared before with the documentation.

If you decided to remove some packages from the release make sure to do amend the commit in this way:

* find the packages you removed in `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers-<PROVIDER>`
* remove the latest version (the one you were releasing)
* update `stable.txt` to the previous version
* in the (unlikely) event you are removing first version of package:
   * remove whole `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers-<PROVIDER>` folder
   * remove package from `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers/core-extensions/index.html` (2 places)
   * remove package from `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers/core-extensions/connections.html` (2 places)
   * remove package from `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers/core-extensions/extra-links.html` (2 places)
   * remove package from `docs-archive/apache-airflow-providers/core-extensions/packages-ref.html` (5 places)

## Add tags in git

Assume that your remote for apache repository is called `apache` you should now
set tags for the providers in the repo.

Sometimes in cases when there is a connectivity issue to Github, it might be possible that local tags get created
and lead to annoying errors. The default behaviour would be to clean such local tags up.

If you want to disable this behaviour, set the env **CLEAN_LOCAL_TAGS** to false.

```shell script
cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
./dev/provider_packages/tag_providers.sh
```

## Update providers metadata

```shell script
cd ${AIRFLOW_REPO_ROOT}
git checkout main
git pull
current_date=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d%n')
branch="update-providers-metadata-${current_date}"
git checkout -b "${branch}"
breeze release-management generate-providers-metadata --refresh-constraints
git add -p .
git commit -m "Update providers metadata ${current_date}"
git push --set-upstream origin "${branch}"
```

Create PR and get it merged

## Notify developers of release

Notify users@airflow.apache.org (cc'ing dev@airflow.apache.org) that
the artifacts have been published.

Subject:

[ANNOUNCE] Apache Airflow Providers prepared on DATE OF RELEASE are released

Body:

```
Dear Airflow community,

I'm happy to announce that new versions of Airflow Providers packages prepared on DATE OF RELEASE
were just released. Full list of PyPI packages released is added at the end of the message.

The source release, as well as the binary releases, are available here:

https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/installing-from-sources

You can install the providers via PyPI: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/installing-from-pypi

The documentation is available at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/ and linked from the PyPI packages.

----

Full list of released PyPI packages:

TODO: Paste the list of packages here that you put on the side. Sort them alphabetically.

Cheers,
<your name>
```

Send the same email to announce@apache.org, except change the opening line to `Dear community,`.
It is more reliable to send it via the web ui at https://lists.apache.org/list.html?announce@apache.org
(press "c" to compose a new thread)

Note If you choose sending it with your email client make sure the email is set to plain text mode.
Trying to send HTML content will result in failure.

## Send announcements about security issues fixed in the release

The release manager should review and mark as READY all the security issues fixed in the release.
Such issues are marked as affecting `< <JUST_RELEASED_VERSION>` in the CVE management tool
at https://cveprocess.apache.org/. Then the release manager should announced the issues via the tool.

Once announced, each of the issue should be linked with a 'reference' with tag 'vendor advisory' with the
URL to the announcement published automatically by the CVE management tool.
Note that the announce@apache.org is moderated, and the link to the email thread will not be published
immediately, that's why it is recommended to add the link to users@airflow.apache.org which takes usually
few seconds to be published after the CVE tool sends them.

The ASF Security will be notified and will submit to the CVE project and will set the state to 'PUBLIC'.

## Announce about the release in social media

NOTE!


As a rule we announce only new providers that were added.
If you believe there is a reason to announce in social media for another case consult with PMCs about it.

Example for special cases:

* an exciting new capability that the community waited for and should have big impact.
* big number of providers released at once.
* bumping min airflow version (which is a special case of the above)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Announcement is done from official Apache-Airflow accounts.

* Twitter: https://twitter.com/ApacheAirflow
* Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/apache-airflow/
* Fosstodon: https://fosstodon.org/@airflow
