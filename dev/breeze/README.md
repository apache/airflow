Apache Airflow Breeze
------------------------

The project is part of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) - it's a development environment
that is used by Airflow developers to effortlessly setup and maintain consistent development environment
for Airflow Development.

This package should never be installed in "production" mode. The `breeze` entrypoint will actually
fail if you do so. It is supposed to be installed only in [editable/development mode](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#working-in-development-mode)
directly from Airflow sources using `pipx` - usually with `--force` flag to account for re-installation
that might often be needed if dependencies change during development.

```shell
pipx install -e ./dev/breeze --force
```

You can read more about Breeze in the [documentation](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/BREEZE.rst)

This README file contains automatically generated hash of the `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files that were
available when the package was installed. Since this file becomes part of the installed package, it helps
to detect automatically if any of the files have changed. If they did, the user will be warned to upgrade
their installations.

PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE HASH BELOW! IT IS AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED BY PRE-COMMIT.
