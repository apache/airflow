I have a kind request for all the contributors to the latest provider packages release.
Could you please help us to test the RC versions of the providers?

Let us know in the comment, whether the issue is addressed.

Those are providers that require testing as there were some substantial changes introduced:

{% for provider_id, provider_info in providers.items()  %}
## Provider [{{ provider_id }}: {{ provider_info.version }}{{ suffix }}](https://pypi.org/project/{{ provider_info.pypi_package_name }}/{{ provider_info.version }}{{ suffix }})
{%- for pr in provider_info.pr_list %}
   - [ ] [{{ pr.title }} (#{{ pr.number }})]({{ pr.html_url }}): @{{ pr.user.login }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endfor %}

The guidelines on how to test providers can be found in

[Verify providers by contributors](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/README_RELEASE_PROVIDER_PACKAGES.md#verify-by-contributors)

<!--

NOTE TO RELEASE MANAGER:

Please move here the providers that have doc-only changes or for which changes are trivial, and
you could assess that they are OK. In case

The providers are automatically installed on Airflow 2.3 and latest `main` during the CI, so we know they
are installable. Also, all classes within the providers are imported during the CI run so we know all
providers can be imported.
