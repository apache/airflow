Default configuration for this branch. Those two variables below
should be the only one that should be changed when we branch off
different airflow branch.

This file is different in every branch (`main`, `vX_Y_test' of airflow)
The _stable branches have the same values as _test branches.

Examples:

    main:

        AIRFLOW_BRANCH = "main"
        DEFAULT_AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_BRANCH = "constraints-main"

    v2-2-test:

        AIRFLOW_BRANCH = "v2-2-test"
        DEFAULT_AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_BRANCH = "constraints-2-2"

"""

AIRFLOW_BRANCH = "main"
DEFAULT_AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_BRANCH = "constraints-main"
