"""
Finds which newer dependencies were used to build that build and prints them for better diagnostics.

This is a common problem that currently `pip` does not produce "perfect" information about the errors,
and we sometimes need to guess what new dependency caused long backtracking. Once we know short
list of candidates, we can (following a manual process) pinpoint the actual culprit.

This small tool is run in CI whenever the image build timed out - so that we can easier guess
which dependency caused the problem.

The process to follow once you see the backtracking is described in:
