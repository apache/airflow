Airflow Breeze CI environment
=============================

Airflow Breeze is an easy-to-use development and test environment using
`Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_.
The environment is available for local use and is also used in Airflow's CI tests.

We call it *Airflow Breeze* as **It's a Breeze to contribute to Airflow**.

The advantages and disadvantages of using the Breeze environment vs. other ways of testing Airflow
are described in
`Integration test development environments <../../../contributing-docs/06_development_environments.rst>`_.

You can use the Breeze environment to run Airflow's tests locally and reproduce CI failures.

The following documents describe how to use the Breeze environment:

* `Installation <01_installation.rst>`_ - describes how to install the Breeze environment on your machine.
* `Customizing <02_customizing.rst>`_ - describes how to customize the Breeze environment.
* `Developer tasks <03_developer_tasks.rst>`_ - describes how to use Breeze for regular developer tasks.
* `Troubleshooting <04_troubleshooting.rst>`_ - describes how to troubleshoot the Breeze environment.
* `Test commands <05_test_commands.rst>`_ - describes how to run Airflow's tests (and reproduce CI failures) using the Breeze environment.
* `Managing Docker images <06_managing_docker_images.rst>`_ - describes how to manage the Breeze images.
* `Breeze maintenance tasks <07_breeze_maintenance_tasks.rst>`_ - describes how to perform maintenance tasks when you develop Breeze itself.
* `CI tasks <08_ci_tasks.rst>`_ - describes how Breeze commands are used in our CI.
* `Release management tasks <09_release_management_tasks.rst>`_ - describes how to use Breeze for release management tasks.
* `Advanced Breeze topics <10_advanced_breeze_topics.rst>`_ - describes advanced Breeze topics/internals of Breeze.

You can also learn more context and Architecture Decisions taken when developing Breeze in the
`Architecture Decision Records <adr>`_.

Next step: Follow the `Installation <01_installation.rst>`__ instructions to install the Breeze environment.
