Managing Docker images
======================

This document describes how to manage Breeze images CI and PROD - used to run containerized
Airflow development environment and tests.

.. contents:: :local:

CI Image tasks
--------------

The image building is usually run for users automatically when needed,
but sometimes Breeze users might want to manually build, pull or verify the CI images.

.. image:: ./images/output_ci-image.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_ci-image.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze ci-image

For all development tasks, unit tests, integration tests, and static code checks, we use the
**CI image** maintained in GitHub Container Registry.

The CI image is built automatically as needed, however it can be rebuilt manually with
``ci image build`` command.

Building the image first time pulls a pre-built version of images from the Docker Hub, which may take some
time. But for subsequent source code changes, no wait time is expected.
However, changes to sensitive files like ``pyproject.toml`` or ``Dockerfile.ci`` will trigger a rebuild
that may take more time though it is highly optimized to only rebuild what is needed.

Breeze has built in mechanism to check if your local image has not diverged too much from the
latest image build on CI. This might happen when for example latest patches have been released as new
Python images or when significant changes are made in the Dockerfile. In such cases, Breeze will
download the latest images before rebuilding because this is usually faster than rebuilding the image.

Building CI image
.................

These are all available flags of ``ci-image build`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_ci-image_build.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_ci-image_build.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze ci-image build

Pulling CI image
................

You can also pull the CI images locally in parallel with optional verification.

These are all available flags of ``pull`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_ci-image_pull.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_ci-image_pull.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze ci-image pull

Verifying CI image
..................

Finally, you can verify CI image by running tests - either with the pulled/built images or
with an arbitrary image.

These are all available flags of ``verify`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_ci-image_verify.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_ci-image_verify.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze ci-image verify

PROD Image tasks
----------------

Users can also build Production images when they are developing them. However when you want to
use the PROD image, the regular docker build commands are recommended. See
`building the image <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html>`_

.. image:: ./images/output_prod-image.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_prod-image.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze prod-image

The **Production image** is also maintained in GitHub Container Registry for Caching
and in ``apache/airflow`` manually pushed for released versions. This Docker image (built using official
Dockerfile) contains size-optimised Airflow installation with selected extras and dependencies.

However in many cases you want to add your own custom version of the image - with added apt dependencies,
python dependencies, additional Airflow extras. Breeze's ``prod-image build`` command helps to build your own,
customized variant of the image that contains everything you need.

You can building the production image manually by using ``prod-image build`` command.
Note, that the images can also be built using ``docker build`` command by passing appropriate
build-args as described in `Images documentation <ci/02_images.md>`_ , but Breeze provides several flags that
makes it easier to do it. You can see all the flags by running ``breeze prod-image build --help``,
but here typical examples are presented:

.. code-block:: bash

     breeze prod-image build --additional-airflow-extras "jira"

This installs additional ``jira`` extra while installing airflow in the image.


.. code-block:: bash

     breeze prod-image build --additional-python-deps "torchio==0.17.10"

This install additional pypi dependency - torchio in specified version.

.. code-block:: bash

     breeze prod-image build --additional-dev-apt-deps "libasound2-dev" \
         --additional-runtime-apt-deps "libasound2"

This installs additional apt dependencies - ``libasound2-dev`` in the build image and ``libasound`` in the
final image. Those are development dependencies that might be needed to build and use python packages added
via the ``--additional-python-deps`` flag. The ``dev`` dependencies are not installed in the final
production image, they are only installed in the build "segment" of the production image that is used
as an intermediate step to build the final image. Usually names of the ``dev`` dependencies end with ``-dev``
suffix and they need to also be paired with corresponding runtime dependency added for the runtime image
(without -dev).

.. code-block:: bash

     breeze prod-image build --python 3.8 --additional-dev-deps "libasound2-dev" \
        --additional-runtime-apt-deps "libasound2"

Same as above but uses python 3.8.

Building PROD image
...................

These are all available flags of ``build-prod-image`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_prod-image_build.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_prod-image_build.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze prod-image build

Pulling PROD image
..................

You can also pull PROD images in parallel with optional verification.

These are all available flags of ``pull-prod-image`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_prod-image_pull.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_prod-image_pull.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze prod-image pull

Verifying PROD image
....................

Finally, you can verify PROD image by running tests - either with the pulled/built images or
with an arbitrary image.

These are all available flags of ``verify-prod-image`` command:

.. image:: ./images/output_prod-image_verify.svg
  :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/dev/breeze/images/output_prod-image_verify.svg
  :width: 100%
  :alt: Breeze prod-image verify
