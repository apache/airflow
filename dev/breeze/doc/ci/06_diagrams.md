# CI Sequence diagrams

You can see here the sequence diagrams of the flow happening during the CI Jobs.

## Pull request flow from fork

This is the flow that happens when a pull request is created from a fork - which is the most frequent
pull request flow that happens in Airflow. The "pull_request" workflow does not have write access
to the GitHub Registry, so it cannot push the CI/PROD images there. Instead, we push the images
from the "pull_request_target" workflow, which has write access to the GitHub Registry. Note that
this workflow always uses scripts and workflows from the "target" branch of the "apache/airflow"
repository, so the user submitting such pull request cannot override our build scripts and inject malicious
code into the workflow that has potentially write access to the GitHub Registry (and can override cache).

Security is the main reason why we have two workflows for pull requests and such complex workflows.

## Pull request flow from "apache/airflow" repo

The difference between this flow and the previous one is that the CI/PROD images are built in the
CI workflow and pushed to the GitHub Registry from there. This cannot be done in case of fork
pull request, because Pull Request from forks cannot have "write" access to GitHub Registry. All the steps
except "Build Info" from the "Build Images" workflows are skipped in this case.

THis workflow can be used by maintainers in case they have a Pull Request that changes the scripts and
CI workflows used to build images, because in this case the "Build Images" workflow will use them
from the Pull Request. This is safe, because the Pull Request is from the "apache/airflow" repository
and only maintainers can push to that repository and create Pull Requests from it.

## Merge "Canary" run

This is the flow that happens when a pull request is merged to the "main" branch or pushed to any of
the "v2-*-test" branches. The "Canary" run attempts to upgrade dependencies to the latest versions
and quickly pushes an early cache the CI/PROD images to the GitHub Registry - so that pull requests
can quickly use the new cache - this is useful when Dockerfile or installation scripts change because such
cache will already have the latest Dockerfile and scripts pushed even if some tests will fail.
When successful, the run updates the constraints files in the "constraints-BRANCH" branch with the latest
constraints and pushes both cache and latest  CI/PROD images to the GitHub Registry.

## Scheduled run

This is the flow that happens when a scheduled run is triggered. The "scheduled" workflow is aimed to
run regularly (overnight) even if no new PRs are merged to "main". Scheduled run is generally the
same as "Canary" run, with the difference that the image used to run the tests is built without using
cache - it's always built from the scratch. This way we can check that no "system" dependencies in debian
base image have changed and that the build is still reproducible. No separate diagram is needed for
scheduled run as it is identical to that of "Canary" run.
