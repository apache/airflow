# Debugging CI Jobs in Github Actions

The CI jobs are notoriously difficult to test, because you can only
really see results of it when you run them in CI environment, and the
environment in which they run depend on who runs them (they might be
either run in our Self-Hosted runners (with 64 GB RAM 8 CPUs) or in the
GitHub Public runners (6 GB of RAM, 2 CPUs) and the results will vastly
differ depending on which environment is used. We are utilizing
parallelism to make use of all the available CPU/Memory but sometimes
you need to enable debugging and force certain environments. Additional
difficulty is that `Build Images` workflow is `pull-request-target`
type, which means that it will always run using the `main` version - no
matter what is in your Pull Request.

There are several ways how you can debug the CI jobs when you are
maintainer.

- When you want to tests the build with all combinations of all python,
  backends etc on regular PR, add `full tests needed` label to the PR.
- When you want to test maintainer PR using public runners, add
  `public runners` label to the PR
- When you want to see resources used by the run, add
  `debug ci resources` label to the PR
- When you want to test changes to breeze that include changes to how
  images are build you should push your PR to `apache` repository not to
  your fork. This will run the images as part of the `CI` workflow
  rather than using `Build images` workflow and use the same breeze
  version for building image and testing
- When you want to test changes to `build-images.yml` workflow you
  should push your branch as `main` branch in your local fork. This will
  run changed `build-images.yml` workflow as it will be in `main` branch
  of your fork
- When you are a committer and you change build images workflow, together
  with build scripts, your build might fail because your scripts are used
  in `build-images.yml` workflow, but the workflow is run using the `main`
  version. Setting `non committer build` label will make your PR run using
  the main version of the scripts and the workflow
- When you want to test how changes in your workflow affect `canary` run,
  as maintainer, you should push your PR to `apache` repository not to your
  fork and set `canary` label to the PR
