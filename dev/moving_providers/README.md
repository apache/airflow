# Moving providers to new structure

We are moving providers to a new structure, where each provider has a separate sub-project in
"providers" sub-folder.

This means that we need to migrate some 90+ providers to the new structure. This is a big task and while we
could do it in one huge PR, it would be disruptive and likely take some time to review and fix some individual
edge-cases - even if we have automated most of the work.

This directory contains a script that contributors can use to move a provider (or a few providers to the
new structure as a starting point for their PR. Most of the work is automated, but there will be likely
some manual adjustments needed in more complex cases.

## How to use the script

The script follows https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/ and uses inlined dependencies - so it can be run as-is
by modern tools without creating dedicated virtualenv - the virtualenv with dependencies is
created on-the-fly by PEP 723 compatible tools.

For example this one will make a dry-run of moving Alibaba provider:

```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba
```

And this one will perform update and move the Alibaba provider:


```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba --perform-update
```

## Options


> [!NOTE]
> You can see all the options by running the script with `--help` option:
>
> ```shell
> uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py --help
> ```

By default the script runs in dry run mode, which means it will not make any changes to the file system,
but will print what it would do. To actually move the files, you need to pass `--perform-update` flag.

```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba --perform-update
```

You can specify multiple providers to move in one go:

```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba amazon  microsoft.azure
```

You can specify `--verbose` option to see more details about what the script is doing:

```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba --verbose
```

You can also specify `--quiet` option to see less output:

```shell
uv run dev/moving_providers/move_providers.py alibaba --quiet
```

# What happens under the hood

When you run the script with `--perform-update` flag, you will see the diff of the changes
that the script made, and you will be able to scroll through it (with your configured editor)
to verify that it looks good.

The script will:

* move the provider to the new structure and apply fixes
* build CI image to add the new provider in the image packages
* run static checks to verify that the moved provider code is good and apply auto-fixes in some cases

# What to do next

After all that you need to fix all potential static check problems, run all the tests for the provider and
fix any issues that might happen:

1) Fix all the static check errors, add them to git
2) run `breeze testing providers-tests --test-type 'Providers[LIST_OF_PROVIDER_IDS_MOVED]'` and fix all tests.
3) Add changes to git, create branch, commit the changes and create a PR!

Good luck!
