# AI Coding Rules for React Projects

## What's This?
These files help AI coding assistants (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot or VS Code) use various AI LLM models and this file helps you generate better and beginner friendly React code for your project. 

## How to Use With Your IDE

### For Cursor (VS Code Clone) IDE:
1. Create a `.cursor` folder in your project root
2. Make a `rules` subfolder: `.cursor/rules/`
3. Copy ALL these `.md` files into that folder
4. Restart Cursor - it will automatically apply these rules

### For VSCode (with Copilot):
1. Create a `.github` folder in your project root
2. Make a `copilot` subfolder: `.github/copilot/`
3. Copy these files there
4. Rename them from `.md` to `.copilot/`

### For Other IDEs:
Check your AI plugin's documentation for "custom rules" or "guidelines" support.

## Kindly Note 
- These rules are just suggestions, not strict requirements.
- Edit them to match your personal preference on how you'd like to have the AI work for you in a generic manner.
- You can even add and remove rules accordingly
