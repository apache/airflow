Support for adding Hooks via Airflow Plugins is removed

Hooks should no longer be registered or imported via Airflow's plugin mechanism -- these types of classes
are just treated as plain Python classes by Airflow, so there is no need to register them with Airflow.

Before:

.. code-block:: python

  from airflow.hooks.my_plugin import MyHook

You should instead import it as:

.. code-block:: python

  from my_plugin import MyHook
