Remove insecure dagReports API endpoint that executed user code in API server

The ``/api/v2/dagReports`` endpoint has been removed because it loaded user DAG files directly in the API server process, violating Airflow's security architecture. This endpoint was not used in the UI and had no known consumers. Use the ``airflow dags report`` CLI command instead for DAG loading reports.
