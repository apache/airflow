Public API authentication is migrated to JWT token based authentication for default (Simple Auth Manager) and FAB provider.

The default setting is using API to create a token (JWT) to authenticate the requests to access the API.
The endpoints are populated under ``/auth`` path.
If none of the providers are installed such as FAB, the API will use the default use Simple Auth Manager in the core.

To integrate the same functioning into API requests using FAB provider. Please install ``apache-airflow-providers-fab``.
For more information, please look at :doc:`apache-airflow-providers-fab:auth-manager/api-authentication`.
