Modify the information returned by ``DagBag``

**New behavior:**
- ``DagBag`` now uses ``Path.relative_to`` for consistent cross-platform behavior.
- ``FileLoadStat`` now has two additional nullable fields: ``bundle_path`` and ``bundle_name``.

**Backward compatibility:**
``FileLoadStat`` will no longer produce paths beginning with ``/`` with the meaning of "relative to the dags folder".
This is a breaking change for any custom code that performs string-based path manipulations relying on this behavior.
Users are advised to update such code to use ``pathlib.Path``.
