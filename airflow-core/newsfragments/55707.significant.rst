Reduce default API server workers to 1

The default number of API server workers (``[api] workers``) has been reduced from 4 to 1.

With FastAPI, sync code runs in external thread pools, making multiple workers within a single
process less necessary. Additionally, with uvicorn's spawn behavior instead of fork, there is
no shared copy-on-write memory between workers, so horizontal scaling with multiple API server
instances is now the recommended approach for better resource utilization and fault isolation.

A good starting point for the number of workers is to set it to the number of CPU cores available.
If you do have multiple CPU cores available for the API server, consider deploying multiple API
server instances instead of increasing the number of workers.
