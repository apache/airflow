Add gunicorn support for API server with zero-downtime worker recycling

The API server now supports gunicorn as an alternative server with rolling worker restarts
to prevent memory accumulation in long-running processes.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Rolling worker restarts**: New workers spawn and pass health checks before old workers
  are killed, ensuring zero downtime during worker recycling.

* **Memory sharing**: Gunicorn uses preload + fork, so workers share memory via
  copy-on-write. This significantly reduces total memory usage compared to uvicorn's
  multiprocess mode where each worker loads everything independently.

* **Correct FIFO signal handling**: Gunicorn's SIGTTOU kills the oldest worker (FIFO),
  not the newest (LIFO), which is correct for rolling restarts.

**Configuration:**

.. code-block:: ini

    [api]
    # Use gunicorn instead of uvicorn
    server_type = gunicorn

    # Enable rolling worker restarts every 12 hours
    worker_refresh_interval = 43200

    # Restart workers one at a time
    worker_refresh_batch_size = 1

Or via environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AIRFLOW__API__SERVER_TYPE=gunicorn
    export AIRFLOW__API__WORKER_REFRESH_INTERVAL=43200

**Requirements:**

Install the gunicorn extra: ``pip install 'apache-airflow-core[gunicorn]'``

**Note on uvicorn (default):**

The default uvicorn mode does not support rolling worker restarts because:

1. With workers=1, there is no master process to send signals to
2. uvicorn's SIGTTOU kills the newest worker (LIFO), defeating rolling restart purposes
3. Each uvicorn worker loads everything independently with no memory sharing

If you need worker recycling or memory-efficient multi-worker deployment, use gunicorn.
