SMTP email configuration is now more flexible and supports both legacy config and Airflow Connections.

- You can still configure SMTP via the classic `[smtp]` section in `airflow.cfg` as before.
- You can now also use an Airflow Connection (type `SMTP`) for email sending. If a connection is provided (e.g. via `conn_id`), its values will be used, otherwise the config values are used as fallback.
- Existing setups using only config will continue to work without changes.

**Example usage with a connection:**

```python
send_email_task = EmailOperator(
    conn_id='smtp_default',
    task_id='send_report_by_email',
    to=['user@example.com'],
    subject='Report',
    html_content='Here is your report.',
    files=['/tmp/report.xlsx']
)
```

This allows more dynamic and secure SMTP configuration in Airflow.
