Improved performance of rendered task instance fields cleanup for DAGs with many mapped tasks (~38x faster).

The config ``max_num_rendered_ti_fields_per_task`` is renamed to ``max_num_rendered_ti_fields_per_dag_run``
(old name still works with deprecation warning).

Retention is now based on the N most recent dag runs rather than N most recent task executions,
which may result in fewer records retained for conditional/sparse tasks.
