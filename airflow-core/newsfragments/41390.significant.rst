Support for SubDags is removed

Subdags have been removed from the following locations:

- CLI
- API
- ``SubDagOperator``

This removal marks the end of Subdag support across all interfaces. Users
should transition to using TaskGroups as a more efficient and maintainable
alternative. Please ensure your DAGs are updated to
remove any usage of Subdags to maintain compatibility with future Airflow releases.
