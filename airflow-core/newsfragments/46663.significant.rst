Removed configuration ``scheduler.allow_trigger_in_future``.

A DAG run with logical date in the future can never be started now. This only affects ``schedule=None``.

Instead of using a future date, you can trigger with ``logical_date=None``. A custom ``run_id`` can be supplied if desired. If a date is needed, it can be passed as a DAG param instead.

Property ``allow_future_exec_dates`` on the DAG class has also been removed.
