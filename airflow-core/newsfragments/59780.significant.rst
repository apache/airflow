Methods removed from PriorityWeightStrategy and TaskInstance

On (experimental) class ``PriorityWeightStrategy``, functions ``serialize()``
and ``deserialize()`` were never used anywhere, and have been removed. They
should not be relied on in user code.

On class ``TaskInstance``, functions ``run()``, ``render_templates()``, and
private members related to them have been removed. The class has been
considered internal since 3.0, and should not be relied on in user code.
