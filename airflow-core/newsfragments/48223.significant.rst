The Airflow distribution is now split into multiple distributions.

In Airflow 2, all the dependencies were kept in the ``apache-airflow`` package were dynamically generated at
build time and some of the optional dependencies in the package were excessive due to limitation of the build
system used.

With Airflow 3, Airflow is now split into several independent and isolated distribution packages on top of
already existing ``providers`` and the dependencies are isolated and simplified across those distribution
packages.

While the original installation methods via ``apache-airflow`` distribution package and extras still
work as previously and it installs complete airflow installation ready to serve as scheduler, webserver, triggerer
and worker, the ``apache-airflow`` package is now a meta-package that cab install all the other distribution
packages (mandatory of via optional extras), it's also possible to install only the distribution
packages that are needed for a specific component you want to run airflow with.

One change vs. Airflow 2 is that neither ``apache-airflow`` nor ``apache-airflow-core`` distribution packages
have ``leveldb`` extra that is an optional feature of ``apache-airflow-providers-google`` distribution package.
The simplest way to install ``leveldb`` dependencies is to install ``apache-airflow-providers-google[leveldb]``
