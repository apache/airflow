``enable_xcom_deserialize_support`` configuration option has been removed.

This configuration was previously marked as a security risk due to potential remote code execution vulnerabilities
when deserializing arbitrary Python objects that came in from XComs. The removal is a security improvement since
all custom XCom serialization/deserialization is now handled safely at the worker level, making this configuration
unnecessary in core. Users should migrate to not setting this configuration.
