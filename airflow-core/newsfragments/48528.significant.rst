``SequentialExecutor`` has been removed from the in-tree executors.

This executor was primarily used for local testing but is now redundant, as ``LocalExecutor``
supports SQLite with WAL mode and provides better performance with parallel execution.
Users should switch to ``LocalExecutor`` or ``CeleryExecutor`` as alternatives.
