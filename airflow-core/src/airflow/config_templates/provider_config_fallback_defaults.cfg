# This file contains provider defaults for Airflow configuration, containing fallback default values
# that might be needed when provider classes are being imported - before provider's configuration
# is loaded.
#
# Unfortunately airflow currently performs a lot of stuff during importing and some of that might lead
# to retrieving provider configuration before the defaults for the provider are loaded.
#
# Those are only defaults, so if you have "real" values configured in your configuration (.cfg file or
# environment variables) those will be used as usual.

# NOTE!! Do NOT attempt to remove those default fallbacks thinking that they are unnecessary duplication,
# at least not until we fix the way how airflow imports "do stuff". This is unlikely to succeed.
#
# You've been warned!
