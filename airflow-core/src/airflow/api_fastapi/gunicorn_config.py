Gunicorn configuration hooks for the Airflow API server.

This module provides Gunicorn server hooks that are loaded via the -c config option.
These hooks handle:
- Setting process titles to indicate worker readiness (used by GunicornMonitor)
- Cleaning up ORM connections on worker exit

Usage:
    gunicorn -c python:airflow.api_fastapi.gunicorn_config airflow.api_fastapi.main:app
