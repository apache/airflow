Public API
==========

Airflow public API authentication
---------------------------------

The Airflow public API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authenticating API requests.
Each request made to the Airflow API must include a valid JWT token in the ``Authorization`` header to verify the
identity and permissions of the client.

Generate a JWT token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To interact with the Airflow API, clients must first authenticate and obtain a JWT token.
The token can be generated by making a ``POST`` request to the ``/auth/token`` endpoint, passing the necessary
credentials (e.g., username and password). The ``/auth/token`` endpoint is provided by the auth manager, therefore,
please read the documentation of the auth manager configured in your environment for more details.

Example
*******

Request

.. code-block:: bash

    ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:8080/"
    curl -X POST ${ENDPOINT_URL}/auth/token \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "username": "your-username",
        "password": "your-password"
      }'

Response

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "jwt_token": "<JWT-TOKEN>"
  }

Use the JWT token to call Airflow public API

.. code-block:: bash

    ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:8080/"
    curl -X GET ${ENDPOINT_URL}/api/v2/dags \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT-TOKEN>"

Enabling CORS
-------------

`Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>`_
is a browser security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are initiated
from scripts running in the browser.

``Access-Control-Allow-Headers``, ``Access-Control-Allow-Methods``, and
``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` headers can be added by setting values for
``access_control_allow_headers``, ``access_control_allow_methods``, and
``access_control_allow_origins`` options in the ``[api]`` section of the
``airflow.cfg`` file.

.. code-block:: ini

    [api]
    access_control_allow_headers = origin, content-type, accept
    access_control_allow_methods = POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
    access_control_allow_origins = https://exampleclientapp1.com https://exampleclientapp2.com

Page size limit
---------------

To protect against requests that may lead to application instability, the stable API has a limit of items in response.
The default is 100 items, but you can change it using ``maximum_page_limit``  option in ``[api]``
section in the ``airflow.cfg`` file.
