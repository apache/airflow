UI Overview
===========
The Airflow UI provides a powerful way to monitor, manage, and troubleshoot your data pipelines and data assets. As of
Airflow 3, the UI has been refreshed with a modern look, support for dark and light themes, and a redesigned navigation
experience.

This guide offers a reference-style walkthrough of key UI components, with annotated screenshots to help new and
experienced users alike.

.. note::
   Screenshots in this guide use **dark theme** by default. Select views are also shown in **light theme** for comparison. You can toggle themes from user settings located at the bottom corner of the Airflow UI.

.. _ui-home:

Home Page
---------
The Home Page provides a high-level overview of the system state and recent activity. It is the default landing page in
Airflow 3 and includes:

- **Health indicators** for system components such as the MetaDatabase, Scheduler, Triggerer, and Dag Processor
- **Quick links** to Dags filtered by status (e.g., Failed Dags, Running Dags, Active Dags)
- **Dag and Task Instance history**, showing counts and success/failure rates over a selectable time range
- **Recent asset events**, including materializations and triggered Dags

This page is useful for quickly assessing the health of your environment and identifying recent issues or
asset-triggered events.

.. _ui-dag-list:

Dag List View
-------------

The Dag List View appears when you click the **Dags** tab in the main navigation bar. It displays all Dags available in
your environment, with a clear summary of their status, recent runs, and configuration.

Each row includes:

- **Dag ID**
- **Schedule** and next run time
- **Status of the latest Dag run**
- **Bar chart of recent runs**
- **Tags**, which can be used for grouping or filtering Dags (e.g., ``example``, ``produces``)
- **Pause/resume toggle**
- Links to access Dag-level views

At the top of the view, you can:

- Use **filters** for Dag status, schedule state, and tags
- Use **search** or **advanced search (âŒ˜+K)** to find specific Dags
- Sort the list using the dropdown (e.g., Latest Run Start Date)

.. _ui-dag-details:

Dag Details Page
----------------

Clicking a Dag from the list opens the Dag Details Page. This view offers centralized access to a Dag's metadata, recent
activity, and task-level diagnostics.

Key elements include:

- **Dag metadata**, including ID, owner, tags, schedule, and latest Dag version
- **Action buttons** to trigger the Dag, reparse it, or pause/resume
- **Tabbed interface**: Overview (recent failures, run counts, task logs); Grid View (status heatmap); Graph View (task dependencies); Runs (full run history); Tasks (aggregated stats); Events (system- or asset-triggered); Code (Dag source); and Details (extended metadata)

This page also includes a visual **timeline of recent Dag runs** and a **log preview for failures**, helping users quickly identify issues across runs.

.. _ui-grid-view:

Grid View
'''''''''

The Grid View is the primary interface for inspecting Dag runs and task states. It offers an interactive way to debug,
retry, or monitor workflows over time.

Use Grid View to:

- **Understand the status of recent Dag runs** at a glance
- **Identify failed or retried tasks** by color and tooltip
- **Take action** by clicking a task cell to view logs or mark task instances as successful, failed, or cleared
- **Filter tasks** by name or partial ID
- **Select a run range**, like "last 25 runs" using the dropdown above the grid

Each row represents a task, and each column represents a Dag run. You can hover over any task instance for more detail,
or click to drill down into logs and metadata.

.. _ui-graph-view:

Graph View
''''''''''

The Graph View shows the logical structure of your Dag - how tasks are connected, what order they run in, and how
branching or retries are configured.

This view is helpful when:

- **Debugging why a task didn't run** (e.g., skipped due to a trigger rule)
- **Understanding task dependencies** across complex pipelines
- **Inspecting run-specific task states** (e.g., success, failed, upstream failed)

Each node represents a task. Edges show the dependencies between them. You can click any task to view its metadata and
recent run history.

Use the dropdown at the top to switch between Dag runs and see how task states changed across executions.

.. _ui-asset-views:

Asset Views
-----------

The **Assets** section provides a dedicated interface to monitor and debug asset-centric workflows. Assets represent
logical data unitsâ€”such as files, tables, or modelsâ€”that tasks can produce or consume. Airflow tracks these dependencies
and provides visualizations to better understand their orchestration.

Asset List
''''''''''

The Asset List shows all known assets, grouped by name. For each asset, you can see:

- The group the asset belongs to (if any)
- The Dags that consume the asset
- The tasks that produce the asset

Hovering over a count of Dags or tasks shows a tooltip with the full list of producers or consumers.

.. _ui-admin-views:

Admin Views
-----------

The **Admin** tab provides system-level tools for configuring and extending Airflow. These views are primarily intended for administrators and platform operators responsible for deployment, integration, and performance tuning.

Key pages include:

- **Variables** â€“ Store key-value pairs accessible from Dags. Variables can be used to manage environment-specific parameters or secrets.
- **Connections** â€“ Define connection URIs to external systems such as databases, cloud services, or APIs. These are consumed by Airflow operators and hooks.
- **Pools** â€“ Control resource allocation by limiting the number of concurrently running tasks assigned to a named pool. Useful for managing contention or quota-constrained systems.
- **Providers** â€“ View installed provider packages (e.g., ``apache-airflow-providers-google``), including available hooks, sensors, and operators. This is helpful for verifying provider versions or troubleshooting import errors.
- **Plugins** â€“ Inspect registered Airflow plugins that extend the platform via custom operators, macros, or UI elements.
- **Config** â€“ View the full effective Airflow configuration as parsed from ``airflow.cfg``, environment variables, or overridden defaults. This can help debug issues related to scheduler behavior, secrets backends, and more.

.. note::
   The Admin tab is only visible to users with appropriate RBAC permissions.
