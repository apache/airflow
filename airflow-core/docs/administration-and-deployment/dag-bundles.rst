Dag Bundles
===========

Dag bundle are a collection of dags and other files (think the Airflow 2 dags folder). Unlike Airflow 2, where dags were required to be on local disk and getting
the dags there was the sole responsibility of the deployment manager, Airflow 3 is now able to pull dags from external systems
as well. And since dag bundles support versioning, it also allows Airflow to run a task using a specific version
of the dag bundle, allowing for a dag run to use the same code for the whole run, even if the dag is updated mid way through the run.

What's in a dag bundle? One or more dag files along with their associated files, such as
other Python scripts, configuration files, or other resources. By keeping the bundle at a higher level, it allows for versioning
everything the dag needs to run.

Dag bundles can source the dags from various locations, such as local directories, Git repositories, or other external systems.
Deployment administrators can also write their own dag bundle classes to support custom sources.
You can also define more than 1 dag bundle in an Airflow deployments, allowing for better organization of your dags.

Why Are dag bundles important?
------------------------------

- **Version Control**: By supporting versioning, dag bundles allow dag runs to use the same code for the whole run, even if the dag is updated mid way through the run.
- **Scalability**: With dag bundles, Airflow can efficiently manage large numbers of DAGs by organizing them into logical units.
- **Flexibility**: Dag bundles enable seamless integration with external systems, such as Git repositories, to source dags.

Types of dag bundles
--------------------
Airflow supports multiple types of dag Bundles, each catering to specific use cases:

**airflow.dag_processing.bundles.local.LocalDagBundle**
    These bundles reference a local directory containing DAG files. They are ideal for development and testing environments, but do not support versioning of the bundle, meaning tasks always run using the latest code.

**airflow.providers.git.bundles.git.GitDagBundle**
    These bundles integrate with Git repositories, allowing Airflow to fetch dags directly from a repository.

Configuring dag bundles
-----------------------

Dag bundles are configured in :ref:`config:dag_processor__dag_bundle_config_list`. You can add one or more dag bundles here.

By default, Airflow adds a local dag bundle, which is the same as the old dags folder. This is done for backwards compatibility, and you can remove it if you do not want to use it. You can also keep it and add other dag bundles, such as a git dag bundle.

For example, adding multiple dag bundles to your ``airflow.cfg`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [dag_processor]
    dag_bundle_config_list = [
            {
                "name": "my_git_repo",
                "classpath": "airflow.dag_processing.bundles.git.GitDagBundle",
                "kwargs": {"tracking_ref": "main", "git_conn_id": "my_git_conn"}
            }
            {
              "name": "dags-folder",
              "classpath": "airflow.dag_processing.bundles.local.LocalDagBundle",
              "kwargs": {}
            }
        ]

.. note::

    The whitespace, particularly on the last line, is important so a multi-line value works properly. More details can be found in the
    the `configparser docs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`_.

You can also override the :ref:`config:dag_processor__refresh_interval` per dag bundle by passing it in kwargs.
This controls how often the dag processor refreshes, or looks for new files, in the dag bundles.

Writing custom dag bundles
--------------------------

When implementing your own dag bundle by extending the ``BaseDagBundle`` class, there are several methods you must implement. Below is a guide to help you implement a custom dag bundle.

Abstract Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following methods are abstract and must be implemented in your custom bundle class:

**path**
    This property should return a ``Path`` to the directory where the dag files for this bundle are stored.
    Airflow uses this property to locate the DAG files for processing.

**get_current_version**
    This method should return the current version of the bundle as a string.
    Airflow will use pass this version to ``__init__`` later to get this version of the bundle again when it runs tasks.
    If versioning is not supported, it should return ``None``.

**refresh**
    This method should handle refreshing the bundle's contents from its source (e.g., pulling the latest changes from a remote repository).
    This is used by the dag processor periodically to ensure that the bundle is up-to-date.

Optional Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to the abstract methods, you may choose to override the following methods to customize the behavior of your bundle:

**__init__**
    This method can be extended to initialize the bundle with extra parameters, such as ``tracking_ref`` for the ``GitDagBundle``.
    It should also call the parent class's ``__init__`` method to ensure proper initialization.
    Expensive operations, such as network calls, should be avoided in this method to prevent delays during the bundle's instantiation, and done
    in the ``initialize`` method instead.

**initialize**
    This method is called before the bundle is first used in the dag processor or worker. It allows you to perform expensive operations only when the bundle's content is accessed.

**view_url**
    This method should return a URL as a string to view the bundle on an external system (e.g., a Git repository's web interface).

Other Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Versioning**: If your bundle supports versioning, ensure that ``initialize``, ``get_current_version`` and ``refresh`` are implemented to handle version-specific logic.

- **Concurrency**: Workers may create many bundles simultaneously, and does nothing to serialize calls to the bundle objects. Thus, the bundle class must handle locking if
  that is problematic for the underlying technology. For example, if you are cloning a git repo, the bundle class is responsible for locking to ensure only 1 bundle
  object is cloning at a time. There is a ``lock`` method in the base class that can be used for this purpose, if necessary.
