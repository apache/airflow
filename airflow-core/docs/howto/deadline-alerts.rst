Deadline Alerts
===============

.. warning::
  Deadline Alerts are new in Airflow 3.1 and should be considered experimental. The feature may be
  subject to changes in 3.2 without warning based on user feedback.

|experimental|

Deadline Alerts allow you to set time thresholds for your Dag runs and automatically respond when those
thresholds are exceeded. You can set up Deadline Alerts by choosing a built-in reference point, setting
an interval, and defining a response using either Airflow's Notifiers or a custom callback function.

Migrating from SLA
------------------

For help migrating from SLA to Deadlines, see the :doc:`migration guide </howto/sla-to-deadlines>`

Creating a Deadline Alert
-------------------------

Creating a Deadline Alert requires three mandatory parameters:

* Reference: When to start counting from
* Interval: How far before or after the reference point to trigger the alert
* Callback: A Callback object which contains a path to a callable and optional kwargs to pass to it if the deadline is exceeded

Here is how Deadlines are calculated:

::

    [Reference] ------ [Interval] ------> [Deadline]
        ^                                     ^
        |                                     |
     Start time                          Trigger point

Below is an example Dag implementation. If the Dag has not finished 15 minutes after it was queued, send a Slack message:

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline import AsyncCallback, DeadlineAlert, DeadlineReference
    from airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack_webhook import SlackWebhookNotifier
    from airflow.providers.standard.operators.empty import EmptyOperator

    with DAG(
        dag_id="deadline_alert_example",
        deadline=DeadlineAlert(
            reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT,
            interval=timedelta(minutes=15),
            callback=AsyncCallback(
                SlackWebhookNotifier,
                kwargs={
                    "text": "ðŸš¨ Dag {{ dag_run.dag_id }} missed deadline at {{ deadline.deadline_time }}. DagRun: {{ dag_run }}"
                },
            ),
        ),
    ):
        EmptyOperator(task_id="example_task")

The timeline for this example would look like this:

::

    |------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
        Scheduled    Queued    Started    Deadline
         00:00       00:03      00:05      00:18

.. _built-in-deadline-references:

Using Built-in References
-------------------------

Airflow provides several built-in reference points that you can use with DeadlineAlert:

``DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT``
    Measures time from when the Dag run was queued. Useful for monitoring resource constraints.

``DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_LOGICAL_DATE``
    References when the Dag run was scheduled to start. For example, setting an interval of
    ``timedelta(minutes=15)`` would trigger the alert if the Dag hasn't completed 15 minutes
    after it was scheduled to start, regardless of when (or if) it actually began executing.
    Useful for ensuring scheduled Dags complete before their next scheduled run.

``DeadlineReference.FIXED_DATETIME``
    Specifies a fixed point in time. Useful when Dags must complete by a specific time.

Here's an example using a fixed datetime:

.. code-block:: python

    tomorrow_at_ten = datetime.combine(datetime.now().date() + timedelta(days=1), time(10, 0))

    with DAG(
        dag_id="fixed_deadline_alert",
        deadline=DeadlineAlert(
            reference=DeadlineReference.FIXED_DATETIME(tomorrow_at_ten),
            interval=timedelta(minutes=-30),  # Alert 30 minutes before the reference.
            callback=AsyncCallback(
                SlackWebhookNotifier,
                kwargs={
                    "text": "ðŸš¨ Dag {{ dag_run.dag_id }} missed deadline at {{ deadline.deadline_time }}. DagRun: {{ dag_run }}"
                },
            ),
        ),
    ):
        EmptyOperator(task_id="example_task")

The timeline for this example would look like this:

::

    |------|----------|---------|------------|--------|
         Queued     Start    Deadline    Reference
         09:15      09:17     09:30       10:00

.. note::
    Note that since the interval is a negative value, the deadline is before the reference in this case.

Using Callbacks
---------------

When a deadline is exceeded, the callback's callable is executed with the specified kwargs. You can use an
existing :doc:`Notifier </howto/notifications>` or create a custom callable.  A callback must be an
:class:`~airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline.AsyncCallback`, with support coming soon for
:class:`~airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline.SyncCallback`.

Using Built-in Notifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's an example using the Slack Notifier if the Dag run has not finished within 30 minutes of it being queued:

.. code-block:: python

    with DAG(
        dag_id="slack_deadline_alert",
        deadline=DeadlineAlert(
            reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT,
            interval=timedelta(minutes=30),
            callback=AsyncCallback(
                SlackWebhookNotifier,
                kwargs={
                    "text": "ðŸš¨ Dag {{ dag_run.dag_id }} missed deadline at {{ deadline.deadline_time }}. DagRun: {{ dag_run }}"
                },
            ),
        ),
    ):
        EmptyOperator(task_id="example_task")

Creating Custom Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create custom callables for more complex handling. If ``kwargs`` are specified in the ``Callback``,
they are passed to the callback function. **Asynchronous callbacks** must be defined somewhere in the
Triggerer's system path.

.. note::
    Regarding Async Custom Deadline callbacks:

    * Async callbacks are executed by the Triggerer, so users must ensure they are importable by the Triggerer.
    * One easy way to do this is to place the callable as a top-level method in a new file in the plugins folder.
      Nested callables are not currently supported.
    * The Triggerer will need to be restarted when a callback is added or changed in order to reload the file.


A **custom asynchronous callback** might look like this:

1. Place this method in ``/files/plugins/deadline_callbacks.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    async def custom_async_callback(**kwargs):
        """Handle deadline violation with custom logic."""
        context = kwargs.get("context", {})
        print(f"Deadline exceeded for Dag {context.get("dag_run", {}).get("dag_id")}!")
        print(f"Context: {context}")
        print(f"Alert type: {kwargs.get("alert_type")}")
        # Additional custom handling here

2. Restart your Triggerer.
3. Place this in a Dag file:

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import timedelta

    from deadline_callbacks import custom_async_callback

    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.providers.standard.operators.empty import EmptyOperator
    from airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline import AsyncCallback, DeadlineAlert, DeadlineReference

    with DAG(
        dag_id="custom_deadline_alert",
        deadline=DeadlineAlert(
            reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT,
            interval=timedelta(minutes=15),
            callback=AsyncCallback(
                custom_async_callback,
                kwargs={"alert_type": "time_exceeded"},
            ),
        ),
    ):
        EmptyOperator(task_id="example_task")

Templating and Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, a relatively simple version of the Airflow context is passed to callables and Airflow does not run
:ref:`concepts:jinja-templating` on the kwargs. However, ``Notifier``s already run templating with the
provided context as part of their execution. This means that templating can be used when using a ``Notifier``
as long as the variables being templated are included in the simplified context. This currently includes the
ID and the calculated deadline time of the Deadline Alert as well as the data included in the ``GET`` REST API
response for Dag Run. Support for more comprehensive context and templating will be added in future versions.

Deadline Calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A deadline's trigger time is calculated by adding the ``interval`` to the datetime returned by
the ``reference``. For ``FIXED_DATETIME`` references, negative intervals can be particularly
useful to trigger the callback *before* the reference time.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    next_meeting = datetime(2025, 6, 26, 9, 30)

    DeadlineAlert(
        reference=DeadlineReference.FIXED_DATETIME(next_meeting),
        interval=timedelta(hours=-2),
        callback=notify_team,
    )

This will trigger the alert 2 hours before the next meeting starts.

For ``DAGRUN_LOGICAL_DATE``, the interval is typically positive, setting a deadline relative
to when the Dag was scheduled to run. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    DeadlineAlert(
        reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_LOGICAL_DATE,
        interval=timedelta(hours=1),
        callback=notify_team,
    )

In this case, if a Dag is scheduled to run daily at midnight, the deadline would be triggered
if the Dag hasn't completed by 1:00 AM. This is useful for ensuring that scheduled jobs complete
within a certain timeframe after their intended start time.

The flexibility of combining different references with positive or negative intervals allows
you to create deadlines that suit a wide variety of operational requirements.

Custom References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the built-in references should cover most use cases, and more will be released over time, you
can create custom references by implementing a class that inherits from DeadlineReference.  This may
be useful if you have calendar integrations or other sources that you want to use as a reference.

.. code-block:: python

    class CustomReference(DeadlineReference):
        """A deadline reference that uses a custom data source."""

        # Define any required parameters for your reference
        required_kwargs = {"custom_id"}

        def _evaluate_with(self, *, session: Session, **kwargs) -> datetime:
            """
            Evaluate the reference time using the provided session and kwargs.

            The session parameter can be used for database queries, and kwargs
            will contain any required parameters defined in required_kwargs.
            """
            custom_id = kwargs["custom_id"]
            # Your custom logic here to determine the reference time
            return your_datetime
