# Installs Airflow from $AIRFLOW_BRANCH tip. This is pure optimisation. It is done because we do not want
# to reinstall all dependencies from scratch when pyproject.toml changes. Problem with Docker caching is that
# when a file is changed, when added to docker context, it invalidates the cache and it causes Docker
# build to reinstall all dependencies from scratch. This can take a loooooot of time. Therefore we install
# the dependencies first from main (and uninstall airflow right after) so that we can start installing
# deps from those pre-installed dependencies. It saves few minutes of build time when pyproject.toml changes.
#
# If INSTALL_MYSQL_CLIENT is set to false, mysql extra is removed
# If INSTALL_POSTGRES_CLIENT is set to false, postgres extra is removed
