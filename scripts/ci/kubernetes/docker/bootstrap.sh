# This part is to allow fast iteration with the kubernetes tests
# Pre-installed Airflow from the production image is removed and Airflow is re-installed from the
# sources added during preparing the kubernetes image. This way when we deploy the image
# to KinD we only add latest sources and only that most recent layer is sent to kind
# and airflow always runs with compiled dist web files from pre-compiled dist installed in prod image
