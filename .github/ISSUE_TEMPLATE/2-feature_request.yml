        Thank you for finding the time to propose new feature!

        We really appreciate the community efforts to improve Airflow.

        Features suggested via this form should be small to medium improvements that do not dramatically change Airflow assumptions.
        Note that if you have a code change ready to submit - you don't need to create an feature request
        and can instead open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pulls) directly.
        However, if you don't have the time or the knowledge to implement the feature yourself, this form is the right place to suggest it.
        Please note that suggesting a feature does not guarantee it will be implemented, and any implementation depends on community interest and availability.
        Therefore, please do not request or expect specific timelines or ETAs. The fastest way to get new features is to submit a PR yourself.

        For bigger features, those that are impacting Airflow's architecture, security assumptions,
        backwards compatibility etc. should be discussed in the [airflow devlist](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@airflow.apache.org).
        Such features will need initial discussion - possibly in [discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions), followed by
        [Airflow Improvement Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals) and formal voting.
        If you want to introduce such feature, you need to be prepared to lead a discussion, get consensus
        among the community and eventually conduct a successful
        [vote](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html) in the community.

        **Please note:** Airflow 2.x is in limited support (critical and security fixes only), and reaches
        EOL on April 22, 2026.
        For reporting security issues in any version, please **do not** use this form and refer to the [Security Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md) instead.

        If unsure about the impact of your feature or how to formulate it - please open a [discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions) first to gather
        an initial feedback on your idea, or ask in the other [communication channels](https://airflow.apache.org/community/).

          Rather than telling us how you might implement this feature, try to take a
          step back and describe what you are trying to achieve.

        If want to submit a PR you do not need to open feature request, <b>just create the PR!</b>.
        Especially if you already have a good understanding of how to implement the feature.
        Airflow is a community-managed project and we love to bring new contributors in.
        Find us in #new-contributors on Slack!
        It's optional though - if you have good idea for small feature,
        others might implement it if they pick an interest in it, so feel free to leave that
        checkbox unchecked.
