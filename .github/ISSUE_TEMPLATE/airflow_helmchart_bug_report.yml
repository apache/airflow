        Thank you for finding the time to report the problem!

        We really appreciate the community's efforts to improve Airflow.

        Note that this issue is only for the
        [Official Apache Airflow Helm Chart](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html).
        If you use another 3rd-party Chart, you should report your issue in the repo of that chart instead.

        Note, you do not need to create an issue if you have a change ready to submit!

        You can open a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pulls) immediately instead.
