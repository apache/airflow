# Various Flags to control behaviour of the "Labeler"
labelerFlags:
  # If this flag is changed to 'false', labels would only be added when the PR is first created
  # and not when existing PR is updated.
  # The default is 'true' which means the labels would be added when PR is updated even if they
  # were removed by the user
  labelOnPRUpdates: false

  Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!
  If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our
  Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)

  Here are some useful points:

  - Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits](
  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)
  will help you with that.

  - In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).
  Adding a new operator? Check this short
  [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst)
  Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.

  - Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing
  locally, itâ€™s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.

  - Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from
  Committers.

  - Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all
  communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.

  - Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style](
  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).

  Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better ðŸš€.

  In case of doubts contact the developers at:

  Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org

  Slack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack
