Reporting Vulnerabilities
-------------------------

**⚠️ Please do not file Jira issues for security vulnerabilities as they are public! ⚠️**

The Apache Software Foundation takes security issues very seriously. Apache
Airflow specifically offers security features and is responsive to issues
around its features. If you have any concern around Airflow Security or believe
you have uncovered a vulnerability, we suggest that you get in touch via the
e-mail address security@apache.org. In the message, try to provide a
description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. The security team
will get back to you after assessing the description.

Note that this security address should be used only for undisclosed
vulnerabilities. Dealing with fixed issues or general questions on how to use
the security features should be handled regularly via the user and the dev
lists. Please report any security problems to the project security address
before disclosing it publicly.

The `ASF Security team's page <https://www.apache.org/security/>`_ describes
how vulnerability reports are handled, and includes PGP keys if you wish to use
that.
