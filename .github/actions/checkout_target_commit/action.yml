    #  BE VERY CAREFUL HERE! THIS LINE AND THE END OF THE WARNING. IN PULL REQUEST TARGET WORKFLOW
    #  WE CHECK OUT THE TARGET COMMIT ABOVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE IMAGE FROM SOURCES FROM THE
    #  INCOMING PR, RATHER THAN FROM TARGET BRANCH. THIS IS A SECURITY RISK, BECAUSE THE PR
    #  CAN CONTAIN ANY CODE AND WE EXECUTE IT HERE. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT WE
    #  DO HERE. WE SHOULD NOT EXECUTE ANY CODE THAT COMES FROM THE PR. WE SHOULD NOT RUN ANY BREEZE
    #  COMMAND NOR SCRIPTS NOR COMPOSITE ACTIONS. WE SHOULD ONLY RUN CODE THAT IS EMBEDDED DIRECTLY IN
    #  THIS WORKFLOW - BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY CODE THAT WE CAN TRUST.

      #  AFTER IT'S SAFE. THE `dev`, `scripts/ci` AND `.github/actions` and `.dockerignore` ARE NOW COMING
      #  FROM THE BASE_REF - WHICH IS THE TARGET BRANCH OF THE PR. WE CAN TRUST THAT THOSE SCRIPTS ARE
      #  SAFE TO RUN AND CODE AVAILABLE IN THE DOCKER BUILD PHASE IS CONTROLLED BY THE `.dockerignore`.
      #  ALL THE REST OF THE CODE COMES FROM THE PR, AND FOR EXAMPLE THE CODE IN THE `Dockerfile.ci` CAN
      #  BE RUN SAFELY AS PART OF DOCKER BUILD. BECAUSE IT RUNS INSIDE THE DOCKER CONTAINER AND IT IS
      #  ISOLATED FROM THE RUNNER.
