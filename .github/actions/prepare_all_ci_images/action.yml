    # TODO: Currently we cannot loop through the list of python versions and have dynamic list of
    #       tasks. Instead we hardcode all possible python versions and they - but
    #       this should be implemented in stash action as list of keys to download.
    #       That includes 3.9 - 3.12 as we are backporting it to v2-11-test branch
    #       This is captured in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45268
