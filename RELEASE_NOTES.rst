Airflow 3.0.0 (2025-04-22)
--------------------------
We are proud to announce the General Availability of Apache Airflow 3.0 â€” the most significant release in the project's
history. This version introduces a service-oriented architecture, a stable DAG authoring interface, expanded support for
event-driven and ML workflows, and a fully modernized UI built on React. Airflow 3.0 reflects years of community
investment and lays the foundation for the next era of scalable, modular orchestration.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: A new Task Execution API and ``airflow api-server`` enable task execution in remote environments with improved isolation and flexibility (AIP-72).

- **Edge Executor**: A new executor that supports distributed, event-driven, and edge-compute workflows (AIP-69), now generally available.

- **Stable Authoring Interface**: DAG authors should now use the new ``airflow.sdk`` namespace to import core DAG constructs like ``@dag``, ``@task``, and ``DAG``.

- **Scheduler-Managed Backfills**: Backfills are now scheduled and tracked like regular DAG runs, with native UI and API support (AIP-78).

- **DAG Versioning**: Airflow now tracks structural changes to DAGs over time, enabling inspection of historical DAG definitions via the UI and API (AIP-66).

- **Asset-Based Scheduling**: The dataset model has been renamed and redesigned as assets, with a new ``@asset`` decorator and cleaner event-driven DAG definition (AIP-74, AIP-75).

- **Support for ML and AI Workflows**: DAGs can now run with ``logical_date=None``, enabling use cases such as model inference, hyperparameter tuning, and non-interval workflows (AIP-83).

- **Removal of Legacy Features**: SLAs, SubDAGs, DAG and Xcom pickling, and several internal context variables have been removed. Use the upgrade tools to detect deprecated usage.

- **Split CLI and API Changes**: The CLI has been split into ``airflow`` and ``airflowctl`` (AIP-81), and REST API now defaults to ``logical_date=None`` when triggering a new DAG run.

- **Modern React UI**: A complete UI overhaul built on React and FastAPI includes version-aware views, backfill management, and improved DAG and task introspection (AIP-38, AIP-84).

- **Migration Tooling**: Use **ruff** and **airflow config update** to validate DAGs and configurations. Upgrade requires Airflow 2.7 or later and Python 3.9â€“3.12.

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 introduces the most significant set of changes since the 2.0 release, including architectural shifts, new
execution models, and improvements to DAG authoring and scheduling.

Task Execution API & Task SDK (AIP-72)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow now supports a service-oriented architecture, enabling tasks to be executed remotely via a new Task Execution
API. This API decouples task execution from the scheduler and introduces a stable contract for running tasks outside of
Airflow's traditional runtime environment.

To support this, Airflow introduces the Task SDK â€” a lightweight runtime environment for running Airflow tasks in
external systems such as containers, edge environments, or other runtimes. This lays the groundwork for
language-agnostic task execution and brings improved isolation, portability, and extensibility to Airflow-based
workflows.

Airflow 3.0 also introduces a new ``airflow.sdk`` namespace that exposes the core authoring interfaces for defining DAGs
and tasks. DAG authors should now import objects like ``DAG``, ``@dag``, and ``@task`` from ``airflow.sdk`` rather than
internal modules. This new namespace provides a stable, forward-compatible interface for DAG authoring across future
versions of Airflow.

Edge Executor (AIP-69)
""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 introduces the **Edge Executor** as a generally available feature, enabling execution of tasks in
distributed or remote compute environments. Designed for event-driven and edge-compute use cases, the Edge Executor
integrates with the Task Execution API to support task orchestration beyond the traditional Airflow runtime. This
advancement facilitates hybrid and cross-environment orchestration patterns, allowing task workers to operate closer to
data or application layers.

Scheduler-Managed Backfills (AIP-78)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Backfills are now fully managed by the scheduler, rather than being launched as separate command-line jobs. This change
unifies backfill logic with regular DAG execution and ensures that backfill runs follow the same scheduling, versioning,
and observability models as other DAG runs.

Airflow 3.0 also introduces native UI and REST API support for initiating and monitoring backfills, making them more
accessible and easier to integrate into automated workflows. These improvements lay the foundation for smarter, safer
historical reprocessing â€” now available directly through the Airflow UI and API.

DAG Versioning (AIP-66)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 introduces native DAG versioning. DAG structure changes (e.g., renamed tasks, dependency shifts) are now
tracked directly in the metadata database. This allows users to inspect historical DAG structures through the UI and API,
and lays the foundation for safer backfills, improved observability, and runtime-determined DAG logic.

React UI Rewrite (AIP-38, AIP-84)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 ships with a completely redesigned user interface built on React and FastAPI. This modern architecture
improves responsiveness, enables more consistent navigation across views, and unlocks new UI capabilities â€” including
support for DAG versioning, asset-centric DAG definitions, and more intuitive filtering and search.

The new UI replaces the legacy Flask-based frontend and introduces a foundation for future extensibility and community
contributions.

Asset-Based Scheduling & Terminology Alignment (AIP-74, AIP-75)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The concept of **Datasets** has been renamed to **Assets**, unifying terminology with common practices in the modern
data ecosystem. The internal model has also been reworked to better support future features like asset partitions and
validations.

The ``@asset`` decorator and related changes to the DAG parser enable clearer, asset-centric DAG definitions, allowing
Airflow to more naturally support event-driven and data-aware scheduling patterns.

This renaming impacts modules, classes, functions, configuration keys, and internal models. Key changes include:

- ``Dataset`` â†’ ``Asset``
- ``DatasetEvent`` â†’ ``AssetEvent``
- ``DatasetAlias`` â†’ ``AssetAlias``
- ``airflow.datasets.*`` â†’ ``airflow.sdk.*``
- ``airflow.timetables.simple.DatasetTriggeredTimetable`` â†’ ``airflow.timetables.simple.AssetTriggeredTimetable``
- ``airflow.timetables.datasets.DatasetOrTimeSchedule`` â†’ ``airflow.timetables.assets.AssetOrTimeSchedule``
- ``airflow.listeners.spec.dataset.on_dataset_created`` â†’ ``airflow.listeners.spec.asset.on_asset_created``
- ``airflow.listeners.spec.dataset.on_dataset_changed`` â†’ ``airflow.listeners.spec.asset.on_asset_changed``
- ``core.dataset_manager_class`` â†’ ``core.asset_manager_class``
- ``core.dataset_manager_kwargs`` â†’ ``core.asset_manager_kwargs``

Unified Scheduling Field
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 removes the legacy ``schedule_interval`` and ``timetable`` parameters. DAGs must now use the unified
``schedule`` field for all time- and event-based scheduling logic. This simplifies DAG definition and improves
consistency across scheduling paradigms.

Updated Scheduling Defaults
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 changes the default behavior for new DAGs by setting ``catchup_by_default = False`` in the configuration
file. This means DAGs that do not explicitly set ``catchup=...`` will no longer backfill missed intervals by default.
This change reduces confusion for new users and better reflects the growing use of on-demand and event-driven workflows.

The default DAG schedule has been changed to ``None`` from ``@once``.

Restricted Metadata Database Access
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Task code can no longer directly access the metadata database. Interactions with DAG state, task history, or DAG runs
must be performed via the Airflow REST API or exposed context. This change improves architectural separation and enables
remote execution.

Future Logical Dates No Longer Supported
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow no longer supports triggering DAG runs with a logical date in the future. This change aligns with the logical
execution model and removes ambiguity in backfills and event-driven DAGs. Use ``logical_date=None`` to trigger runs with
the current timestamp.

Context Behavior for Asset and Manually Triggered DAGs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For DAG runs triggered by an Asset event or through the REST API without specifying a ``logical_date``, Airflow now sets
``logical_date=None`` by default. These DAG runs do not have a data interval, and attempting to access
``data_interval_start``, ``data_interval_end``, or ``logical_date`` from the task context will raise a ``KeyError``.

DAG authors should use ``dag_run.logical_date`` and perform appropriate checks or fallbacks if supporting multiple
trigger types. This change improves consistency with event-driven semantics but may require updates to existing DAGs
that assume these values are always present.

Improved Callback Behavior
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 refines task callback behavior to improve clarity and consistency. In particular, ``on_success_callback`` is
no longer executed when a task is marked as ``SKIPPED``, aligning it more closely with expected semantics.

Updated Default Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several default configuration values have been updated in Airflow 3.0 to better reflect modern usage patterns and
simplify onboarding:

- ``catchup_by_default`` is now set to ``False`` by default. DAGs will not automatically backfill unless explicitly configured to do so.
- ``create_cron_data_intervals`` is now set to ``False`` by default. As a result, cron expressions will be interpreted using the ``CronTriggerTimetable`` instead of the legacy ``CronDataIntervalTimetable``.
- ``SimpleAuthManager`` is now the default ``auth_manager``. To continue using Flask AppBuilder-based authentication, install the ``apache-airflow-providers-flask-appbuilder`` provider and explicitly set ``auth_manager = airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.FabAuthManager``.

These changes represent the most significant evolution of the Airflow platform since the release of 2.0 â€” setting the
stage for more scalable, event-driven, and language-agnostic orchestration in the years ahead.

Executor & Scheduler Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 introduces several important improvements and behavior changes in how DAGs and tasks are scheduled,
prioritized, and executed.

Standalone DAG Processor Required
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 now requires the standalone DAG processor to parse DAGs. This dedicated process improves scheduler
performance, isolation, and observability. It also simplifies architecture by clearly separating DAG parsing from
scheduling logic. This change may affect custom deployments that previously used embedded DAG parsing.

Priority Weight Capped by Pool Slots
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``priority_weight`` value on a task is now capped by the number of available pool slots. This ensures that resource
availability remains the primary constraint in task execution order, preventing high-priority tasks from starving others
when resource contention exists.

Teardown Task Handling During DAG Termination
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Teardown tasks will now be executed even when a DAG run is terminated early. This ensures that cleanup logic is
respected, improving reliability for workflows that use teardown tasks to manage ephemeral infrastructure, temporary
files, or downstream notifications.

Improved Scheduler Fault Tolerance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Scheduler components now use ``run_with_db_retries`` to handle transient database issues more gracefully. This enhances
Airflow's fault tolerance in high-volume environments and reduces the likelihood of scheduler restarts due to temporary
database connection problems.

Mapped Task Stats Accuracy
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 fixes a bug that caused incorrect task statistics to be reported for dynamic task mapping. Stats now
accurately reflect the number of mapped task instances and their statuses, improving observability and debugging for
dynamic workflows.

``SequentialExecutor`` has been removed
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``SequentialExecutor`` was primarily used for local testing but is now redundant, as ``LocalExecutor``
supports SQLite with WAL mode and provides better performance with parallel execution.
Users should switch to ``LocalExecutor`` or ``CeleryExecutor`` as alternatives.

DAG Authoring Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 includes several changes that improve consistency, clarity, and long-term stability for DAG authors.

New Stable DAG Authoring Interface: ``airflow.sdk``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 introduces a new, stable public API for DAG authoring under the ``airflow.sdk`` namespace,
available via the ``apache-airflow-task-sdk`` package.

The goal of this change is to **decouple DAG authoring from Airflow internals** (Scheduler, API Server, etc.),
providing a **forward-compatible, stable interface** for writing and maintaining DAGs across Airflow versions.

DAG authors should now import core constructs from ``airflow.sdk`` rather than internal modules.

**Key Imports from** ``airflow.sdk``:

- Classes:

  - ``Asset``
  - ``BaseNotifier``
  - ``BaseOperator``
  - ``BaseOperatorLink``
  - ``BaseSensorOperator``
  - ``Connection``
  - ``Context``
  - ``DAG``
  - ``EdgeModifier``
  - ``Label``
  - ``ObjectStoragePath``
  - ``Param``
  - ``TaskGroup``
  - ``Variable``

- Decorators and Functions:

  - ``@asset``
  - ``@dag``
  - ``@setup``
  - ``@task``
  - ``@task_group``
  - ``@teardown``
  - ``chain``
  - ``chain_linear``
  - ``cross_downstream``
  - ``get_current_context``
  - ``get_parsing_context``

For an exhaustive list of available classes, decorators, and functions, check ``airflow.sdk.__all__``.

All DAGs should update imports to use ``airflow.sdk`` instead of referencing internal Airflow modules directly.
Legacy import paths (e.g., ``airflow.models.dag.DAG``, ``airflow.decorator.task``) are **deprecated** and
will be **removed** in a future Airflow version. Some additional utilities and helper functions
that DAGs sometimes use from ``airflow.utils.*`` and others will be progressively migrated to the Task SDK in future
minor releases.

These future changes aim to **complete the decoupling** of DAG authoring constructs
from internal Airflow services. DAG authors should expect continued improvements
to ``airflow.sdk`` with no backwards-incompatible changes to existing constructs.

For example, update:

.. code-block:: python

    # Old (Airflow 2.x)
    from airflow.models import DAG
    from airflow.decorators import task

    # New (Airflow 3.x)
    from airflow.sdk import DAG, task

Renamed Parameter: ``fail_stop`` â†’ ``fail_fast``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The DAG argument ``fail_stop`` has been renamed to ``fail_fast`` for improved clarity. This parameter controls whether a
DAG run should immediately stop execution when a task fails. DAG authors should update any code referencing
``fail_stop`` to use the new name.

Context Cleanup and Parameter Removal
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several legacy context variables have been removed or may no longer be available in certain types of DAG runs,
including:

- ``conf``
- ``execution_date``
- ``dag_run.external_trigger``

In asset-triggered and manually triggered DAG runs with ``logical_date=None``, data interval fields such as
``data_interval_start`` and ``data_interval_end`` may not be present in the task context. DAG authors should use
explicit references such as ``dag_run.logical_date`` and conditionally check for the presence of interval-related fields
where applicable.

Task Context Utilities Moved
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Internal task context functions such as ``get_parsing_context`` have been moved to a more appropriate location (e.g.,
``airflow.models.taskcontext``). DAG authors using these utilities directly should update import paths accordingly.

Trigger Rule Restrictions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``TriggerRule.ALWAYS`` rule can no longer be used with teardown tasks or tasks that are expected to honor upstream
dependency semantics. DAG authors should ensure that teardown logic is defined with the appropriate trigger rules for
consistent task resolution behavior.

Asset Aliases for Reusability
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A new utility function, ``create_asset_aliases()``, allows DAG authors to define reusable aliases for frequently
referenced Assets. This improves modularity and reuse across DAG files and is particularly helpful for teams adopting
asset-centric DAGs.

Operator Links interface changed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Operator Extra links, which can be defined either via plugins or custom operators
now do not execute any user code in the Airflow UI, but instead push the "full"
links to XCom backend and the link is fetched from the XCom backend when viewing
task details, for example from grid view.

Example for users with custom links class:

.. code-block:: python

  @attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
  class CustomBaseIndexOpLink(BaseOperatorLink):
      """Custom Operator Link for Google BigQuery Console."""

      index: int = attr.ib()

      @property
      def name(self) -> str:
          return f"BigQuery Console #{self.index + 1}"

      @property
      def xcom_key(self) -> str:
          return f"bigquery_{self.index + 1}"

      def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key):
          search_queries = XCom.get_one(
              task_id=ti_key.task_id, dag_id=ti_key.dag_id, run_id=ti_key.run_id, key="search_query"
          )
          return f"https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?j={search_query}"

The link has an ``xcom_key`` defined, which is how it will be stored in the XCOM backend, with key as xcom_key and
value as the entire link, this case: ``https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?j=search``

Plugins no longer support adding executors, operators & hooks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Operator (including Sensors), Executors & Hooks can no longer be registered or imported via Airflow's plugin mechanism. These types of classes
are just treated as plain Python classes by Airflow, so there is no need to register them with Airflow. They
can be imported directly from their respective provider packages.

Before:

.. code-block:: python

  from airflow.hooks.my_plugin import MyHook

You should instead import it as:

.. code-block:: python

  from my_plugin import MyHook

Support for ML & AI Use Cases (AIP-83)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 expands the types of DAGs that can be expressed by removing the constraint that each DAG run must correspond
to a unique data interval. This change, introduced in AIP-83, enables support for workflows that don't operate on a
fixed schedule â€” such as model training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference tasks.

These ML- and AI-oriented DAGs often run ad hoc, are triggered by external systems, or need to execute multiple times
with different parameters over the same dataset. By allowing multiple DAG runs with ``logical_date=None``, Airflow now
supports these scenarios natively without requiring workarounds.

Config & Interface Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 introduces several configuration and interface updates that improve consistency, clarify ownership of core
utilities, and remove legacy behaviors that were no longer aligned with modern usage patterns.

Default Value Handling
""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow no longer silently updates configuration options that retain deprecated default values. Users are now required
to explicitly set any config values that differ from the current defaults. This change improves transparency and
prevents unintentional behavior changes during upgrades.

Refactored Config Defaults
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several configuration defaults have changed in Airflow 3.0 to better reflect modern usage patterns:

- The default value of ``catchup_by_default`` is now ``False``. DAGs will not backfill missed intervals unless explicitly configured to do so.
- The default value of ``create_cron_data_intervals`` is now ``False``. Cron expressions are now interpreted using the ``CronTriggerTimetable`` instead of the legacy ``CronDataIntervalTimetable``. This change simplifies interval logic and aligns with the future direction of Airflow's scheduling system.

Refactored Internal Utilities
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several core components have been moved to more intuitive or stable locations:

- The ``SecretsMasker`` class has been relocated to ``airflow.sdk.execution_time.secrets_masker``.
- The ``ObjectStoragePath`` utility previously located under ``airflow.io`` is now available via ``airflow.sdk``.

These changes simplify imports and reflect broader efforts to stabilize utility interfaces across the Airflow codebase.

Improved ``inlet_events``, ``outlet_events``, and ``triggering_asset_events``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Asset event mappings in the task context are improved to better support asset use cases, including new features introduced in AIP-74.

Events of an asset or asset alias are now accessed directly by a concrete object to avoid ambiguity. Using a ``str`` to access events is
no longer supported. Use an ``Asset`` or ``AssetAlias`` object, or ``Asset.ref`` to refer to an entity explicitly instead, such as::

    outlet_events[Asset.ref(name="myasset")]  # Get events for asset named "myasset".
    outlet_events[AssetAlias(name="myalias")]  # Get events for asset alias named "myalias".

Alternatively, two helpers ``for_asset`` and ``for_asset_alias`` are added as shortcuts::

    outlet_events.for_asset(name="myasset")  # Get events for asset named "myasset".
    outlet_events.for_asset_alias(name="myalias")  # Get events for asset alias named "myalias".

The internal representation of asset event triggers now also includes an explicit ``uri`` field, simplifying traceability and
aligning with the broader asset-aware execution model introduced in Airflow 3.0. DAG authors interacting directly with
``inlet_events`` may need to update logic that assumes the previous structure.

Behaviour change in ``xcom_pull``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In Airflow 2, the ``xcom_pull()`` method allowed pulling XComs by key without specifying task_ids, despite the fact that the underlying
DB model defines task_id as part of the XCom primary key. This created ambiguity: if two tasks pushed XComs with the same key,
``xcom_pull()`` would pull whichever one happened to be first, leading to unpredictable behavior.

Airflow 3 resolves this inconsistency by requiring ``task_ids`` when pulling by key. This change aligns with the task-scoped nature of
XComs as defined by the schema, ensuring predictable and consistent behavior.

DAG Authors should update their dags to use ``task_ids`` if their dags used ``xcom_pull`` without ``task_ids`` such as::

  kwargs["ti"].xcom_pull(key="key")

Should be updated to::

  kwargs["ti"].xcom_pull(task_ids="task1", key="key")


Removed Configuration Keys
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As part of the deprecation cleanup, several legacy configuration options have been removed. These include:

- ``[scheduler] allow_trigger_in_future``
- ``[scheduler] use_job_schedule``
- ``[scheduler] use_local_tz``
- ``[scheduler] processor_poll_interval``
- ``[logging] dag_processor_manager_log_location``
- ``[logging] dag_processor_manager_log_stdout``
- ``[logging] log_processor_filename_template``

All the webserver configurations have also been removed since API server now replaces webserver, so
the configurations like below have no effect:

- ``[webserver] allow_raw_html_descriptions``
- ``[webserver] cookie_samesite``
- ``[webserver] error_logfile``
- ``[webserver] access_logformat``
- ``[webserver] web_server_master_timeout``
- etc

Several configuration options previously located under the ``[webserver]`` section have
been **moved to the new ``[api]`` section**. The following configuration keys have been moved:

- ``[webserver] web_server_host`` â†’ ``[api] host``
- ``[webserver] web_server_port`` â†’ ``[api] port``
- ``[webserver] workers`` â†’ ``[api] workers``
- ``[webserver] web_server_worker_timeout`` â†’ ``[api] worker_timeout``
- ``[webserver] web_server_ssl_cert`` â†’ ``[api] ssl_cert``
- ``[webserver] web_server_ssl_key`` â†’ ``[api] ssl_key``
- ``[webserver] access_logfile`` â†’ ``[api] access_logfile``

Users should review their ``airflow.cfg`` files or use the ``airflow config lint`` command to identify outdated or
removed options.

Upgrade Tooling
""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 includes improved support for upgrade validation. Use the following tools to proactively catch incompatible
configs or deprecated usage patterns:

- ``airflow config lint``: Identifies removed or invalid config keys
- ``ruff check --select AIR30 --preview``: Flags removed interfaces and common migration issues

CLI & API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 introduces changes to both the CLI and REST API interfaces to better align with service-oriented deployments
and event-driven workflows.

Split CLI Architecture (AIP-81)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Airflow CLI has been split into two distinct interfaces:

- The core ``airflow`` CLI now handles only local functionality (e.g., ``airflow tasks test``, ``airflow dags list``).
- Remote functionality, including triggering DAGs or managing connections in service-mode environments, is now handled by a separate CLI called ``airflowctl``, distributed via the ``apache-airflow-client`` package.

This change improves security and modularity for deployments that use Airflow in a distributed or API-first context.

REST API v2 replaces v1
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The legacy REST API v1, previously built with Connexion and Marshmallow, has been replaced by a modern FastAPI-based REST API v2.

This new implementation improves performance, aligns more closely with web standards, and provides a consistent developer experience across the API and UI.

Key changes include stricter validation (422 errors instead of 400), the removal of the ``execution_date`` parameter in favor of ``logical_date``, and more consistent query parameter handling.

The v2 API is now the stable, fully supported interface for programmatic access to Airflow, and also powers the new UI - achieving full feature parity between the UI and API.

For details, see the :doc:`Airflow REST API v2 </stable-rest-api-ref>` documentation.

REST API: DAG Trigger Behavior Updated
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The behavior of the ``POST /dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns`` endpoint has changed. If a ``logical_date`` is not explicitly
provided when triggering a DAG via the REST API, it now defaults to ``None``.

This aligns with event-driven DAGs and manual runs in Airflow 3.0, but may break backward compatibility with scripts or
tools that previously relied on Airflow auto-generating a timestamped ``logical_date``.

Removed CLI Flags and Commands
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Several deprecated CLI arguments and commands that were marked for removal in earlier versions have now been cleaned up
in Airflow 3.0. Run ``airflow --help`` to review the current set of available commands and arguments.

- Deprecated ``--ignore-depends-on-past``  cli option is replaced by ``--depends-on-past ignore``.

- ``--tree`` flag for ``airflow tasks list`` command is removed. The format of the output with that flag can be
  expensive to generate and extremely large, depending on the DAG. ``airflow dag show`` is a better way to
  visualize the relationship of tasks in a DAG.

- Changing ``dag_id`` from flag (``-d``, ``--dag-id``) to a positional argument in the ``dags list-runs`` CLI command.

- The ``airflow db init`` and ``airflow db upgrade`` commands have been removed. Use ``airflow db migrate`` instead
  to initialize or migrate the metadata database. If you would like to create default connections use
  ``airflow connections create-default-connections``.

- ``airflow api-server`` has replaced ``airflow webserver`` cli command.


Provider Refactor & Standardization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 completes the migration of several core operators, sensors, and hooks into the new
``apache-airflow-providers-standard`` package. This package now includes commonly used components such as:

- ``PythonOperator``
- ``BashOperator``
- ``EmailOperator``
- ``SimpleHttpOperator``
- ``ShortCircuitOperator``

These operators were previously bundled inside ``airflow-core`` but are now treated as provider-managed components to
improve modularity, testability, and lifecycle independence.

This change enables more consistent versioning across providers and prepares Airflow for a future where all integrations
â€” including "standard" ones â€” follow the same interface model.

To maintain compatibility with existing DAGs, the ``apache-airflow-providers-standard`` package is installable on both
Airflow 2.x and 3.x. Users upgrading from Airflow 2.x are encouraged to begin updating import paths and testing provider
installation in advance of the upgrade.

Legacy imports such as ``airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator`` are deprecated and will be removed soon. They should be
replaced with:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator

UI & Usability Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3.0 introduces a modernized user experience that complements the new React-based UI architecture (see
Significant Changes). Several areas of the interface have been enhanced to improve visibility, consistency, and
navigability.

New Home Page
"""""""""""""

The Airflow Home page now provides a high-level operational overview of your environment. It includes health checks for
core components (Scheduler, Triggerer, DAG Processor), summary stats for DAG and task instance states, and a real-time
feed of asset-triggered events. This view helps users quickly identify pipeline health, recent activity, and potential
failures.

Unified DAG List View
""""""""""""""""""""""

The DAG List page has been refreshed with a cleaner layout and improved responsiveness. Users can browse DAGs by name,
tags, or owners. While full-text search has not yet been integrated, filters and navigation have been refined for
clarity in large deployments.

Version-Aware Graph and Grid Views
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Graph and Grid views now display task information in the context of the DAG version that was used at runtime. This
improves traceability for DAGs that evolve over time and provides more accurate debugging of historical runs.

Expanded DAG Graph Visualization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Graph view now supports visualizing the full chain of asset and task dependencies, including assets consumed or
produced across DAG boundaries. This allows users to inspect upstream and downstream lineage in a unified view, making
it easier to trace data flows, debug triggering behavior, and understand conditional dependencies between assets and
tasks.

DAG Code View
"""""""""""""

The "Code" tab now displays the exact DAG source as parsed by the scheduler for the selected DAG version. This allows
users to inspect the precise code that was executed, even for historical runs, and helps debug issues related to
versioned DAG changes.

Improved Task Log Access
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Task log access has been streamlined across views. Logs are now easier to access from both the Grid and Task Instance
pages, with cleaner formatting and reduced visual noise.

Enhanced Asset and Backfill Views
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

New UI components support asset-centric DAGs and backfill workflows:

- Asset definitions are now visible from the DAG details page, allowing users to inspect upstream and downstream asset relationships.
- Backfills can be triggered and monitored directly from the UI, including support for scheduler-managed backfills introduced in Airflow 3.0.

These improvements make Airflow more accessible to operators, data engineers, and stakeholders working across both
time-based and event-driven workflows.

Deprecations & Removals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of deprecated features, modules, and interfaces have been removed in Airflow 3.0, completing long-standing
migrations and cleanups.

Users are encouraged to review the following removals to ensure compatibility:

- **SubDag support has been removed** entirely, including the ``SubDagOperator``, related CLI and API interfaces. TaskGroups are now the recommended alternative for nested DAG structures.

- **SLAs have been removed**: The legacy SLA feature, including SLA callbacks and metrics, has been removed. A more flexible replacement mechanism, ``DeadlineAlerts``, is planned for a future version of Airflow. Users who relied on SLA-based notifications should consider implementing custom alerting using task-level success/failure hooks or external monitoring integrations.

- **Pickling support has been removed**: All legacy features related to DAG pickling have been fully removed. This includes the ``PickleDag`` CLI/API, as well as implicit behaviors around ``store_serialized_dags = False``. DAGs must now be serialized using the JSON-based serialization system. Ensure any custom Python objects used in DAGs are JSON-serializable.

- **Context parameter cleanup**: Several previously available context variables have been removed from the task execution context, including ``conf``, ``execution_date``, and ``dag_run.external_trigger``. These values are either no longer applicable or have been renamed (e.g., use ``dag_run.logical_date`` instead of ``execution_date``). DAG authors should ensure that templated fields and Python callables do not reference these deprecated keys.

- **Deprecated core imports** have been fully removed. Any use of ``airflow.operators.*``, ``airflow.hooks.*``, or similar legacy import paths should be updated to import from their respective providers.

- **Configuration cleanup**: Several legacy config options have been removed, including:

  - ``scheduler.allow_trigger_in_future``: DAG runs can no longer be triggered with a future logical date. Use ``logical_date=None`` instead.
  - ``scheduler.use_job_schedule`` and ``scheduler.use_local_tz`` have also been removed. These options were deprecated and no longer had any effect.

- **Deprecated utility methods** such as those in ``airflow.utils.helpers``, ``airflow.utils.process_utils``, and ``airflow.utils.timezone`` have been removed. Equivalent functionality can now be found in the standard Python library or Airflow provider modules.

- **Removal of deprecated CLI flags and behavior**: Several CLI entrypoints and arguments that were marked for removal in earlier versions have been cleaned up.

To assist with the upgrade, tools like ``ruff`` (e.g., rule ``AIR302``) and ``airflow config lint`` can help identify
obsolete imports and configuration keys. These utilities are recommended for locating and resolving common
incompatibilities during migration. Please see :doc:`Upgrade Guide <installation/upgrading_to_airflow3>` for more
information.

Migration Tooling & Upgrade Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Airflow 3 was designed with migration in mind. Many Airflow 2 DAGs will work without changes, especially if deprecation
warnings were addressed in earlier releases. To support the upgrade, Airflow 3 includes validation tools such as ``ruff``
and ``airflow config update``, as well as a simplified startup model.

For a step-by-step upgrade process, see the :doc:`Upgrade Guide <installation/upgrading_to_airflow3>`.

Minimum Supported Versions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To upgrade to Airflow 3.0, you must be running **Airflow 2.7 or later**.

Airflow 3.0 supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12

Earlier versions of Airflow or Python are not supported due to architectural changes and updated dependency requirements.

DAG Compatibility Checks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow now includes a Ruff-based linter with custom rules to detect DAG patterns and interfaces that are no longer
compatible with Airflow 3.0. These checks are packaged under the ``AIR30x`` rule series. Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    ruff check dags/ --select AIR301  --preview
    ruff check dags/ --select AIR301 --fix  --preview

These checks can automatically fix many common issues such as renamed arguments, removed imports, or legacy context
variable usage.

Configuration Migration
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow 3.0 introduces a new utility to validate and upgrade your Airflow configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow config update
    airflow config update --fix

This utility detects removed or deprecated configuration options and, if desired, updates them in-place.

Additional validation is available via:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow config lint

This command surfaces obsolete configuration keys and helps align your environment with Airflow 3.0 requirements.

Metadata Database Upgrade
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

As with previous major releases, the Airflow 3.0 upgrade includes schema changes to the metadata database. Before
upgrading, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database and optionally run:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow db clean

to remove old task instance, log, or XCom data. To apply the new schema:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow db migrate

Startup Behavior Changes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Airflow components are now started explicitly. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow api-server        # Replaces airflow webserver
    airflow dag-processor     # Required in all environments

These changes reflect Airflow's new service-oriented architecture.

Airflow 2.11.0 (2025-05-20)
---------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``DeltaTriggerTimetable`` for trigger-based scheduling (#47074)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This change introduces DeltaTriggerTimetable, a new built-in timetable that complements the existing suite of
Airflow timetables by supporting delta-based trigger schedules without relying on data intervals.

Airflow currently has two major types of timetables:
    - Data interval-based (e.g., ``CronDataIntervalTimetable``, ``DeltaDataIntervalTimetable``)
    - Trigger-based (e.g., ``CronTriggerTimetable``)

However, there was no equivalent trigger-based option for delta intervals like ``timedelta(days=1)``.
As a result, even simple schedules like ``schedule=timedelta(days=1)`` were interpreted through a data interval
lensâ€”adding unnecessary complexity for users who don't care about upstream/downstream data dependencies.

This feature is backported to Airflow 2.11.0 to help users begin transitioning before upgrading to Airflow 3.0.

    - In Airflow 2.11, ``schedule=timedelta(...)`` still defaults to ``DeltaDataIntervalTimetable``.
    - A new config option ``[scheduler] create_delta_data_intervals`` (default: ``True``) allows opting in to ``DeltaTriggerTimetable``.
    - In Airflow 3.0, this config defaults to ``False``, meaning ``DeltaTriggerTimetable`` becomes the default for timedelta schedules.

By flipping this config in 2.11, users can preview and adopt the new scheduling behavior in advance â€” minimizing surprises during upgrade.


Consistent timing metrics across all backends (#39908, #43966)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, Airflow reported timing metrics in milliseconds for ``StatsD`` but in seconds for other backends
such as ``OpenTelemetry`` and ``Datadog``. This inconsistency made it difficult to interpret or compare
timing metrics across systems.

Airflow 2.11 introduces a new config option:

  - ``[metrics] timer_unit_consistency`` (default: ``False`` in 2.11, ``True`` and dropped in Airflow 3.0).

When enabled, all timing metrics are consistently reported in milliseconds, regardless of the backend.

This setting has become mandatory and always ``True`` in Airflow 3.0 (the config will be removed), so
enabling it in 2.11 allows users to migrate early and avoid surprises during upgrade.

Ease migration to Airflow 3
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This release introduces several changes to help users prepare for upgrading to Airflow 3:

  - All models using ``execution_date`` now also include a ``logical_date`` field. Airflow 3 drops ``execution_date`` entirely in favor of ``logical_date`` (#44283)
  - Added ``airflow config lint`` and ``airflow config update`` commands in 2.11 to help audit and migrate configs for Airflow 3.0. (#45736, #50353, #46757)

Python 3.8 support removed
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Support for Python 3.8 has been removed, as it has reached end-of-life.
Airflow 2.11 requires Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12.

Airflow 2.10.5 (2025-02-10)
---------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure teardown tasks are executed when DAG run is set to failed (#45530)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously when a DAG run was manually set to "failed" or to "success" state the terminal state was set to all tasks.
But this was a gap for cases when setup- and teardown tasks were defined: If teardown was used to clean-up infrastructure
or other resources, they were also skipped and thus resources could stay allocated.

As of now when setup tasks had been executed before and the DAG is manually set to "failed" or "success" then teardown
tasks are executed. Teardown tasks are skipped if the setup was also skipped.

As a side effect this means if the DAG contains teardown tasks, then the manual marking of DAG as "failed" or "success"
will need to keep the DAG in running state to ensure that teardown tasks will be scheduled. They would not be scheduled
if the DAG is directly set to "failed" or "success".

Airflow 2.10.4 (2024-12-16)
---------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TaskInstance ``priority_weight`` is capped in 32-bit signed integer ranges (#43611)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Some database engines are limited to 32-bit integer values. As some users reported errors in
weight rolled-over to negative values, we decided to cap the value to the 32-bit integer. Even
if internally in python smaller or larger values to 64 bit are supported, ``priority_weight`` is
capped and only storing values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

Bug Fixes

Airflow 2.10.0 (2024-08-15)
---------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scarf based telemetry: Airflow now collect telemetry data (#39510)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Airflow integrates Scarf to collect basic usage data during operation. Deployments can opt-out of data collection by
setting the ``[usage_data_collection]enabled`` option to ``False``, or the ``SCARF_ANALYTICS=false`` environment variable.

Datasets no longer trigger inactive DAGs (#38891)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, when a DAG is paused or removed, incoming dataset events would still
trigger it, and the DAG would run when it is unpaused or added back in a DAG
file. This has been changed; a DAG's dataset schedule can now only be satisfied
by events that occur when the DAG is active. While this is a breaking change,
the previous behavior is considered a bug.

The behavior of time-based scheduling is unchanged, including the timetable part
of ``DatasetOrTimeSchedule``.

``try_number`` is no longer incremented during task execution (#39336)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Previously, the try number (``try_number``) was incremented at the beginning of task execution on the worker. This was problematic for many reasons.
For one it meant that the try number was incremented when it was not supposed to, namely when resuming from reschedule or deferral. And it also resulted in
the try number being "wrong" when the task had not yet started. The workarounds for these two issues caused a lot of confusion.

Now, instead, the try number for a task run is determined at the time the task is scheduled, and does not change in flight, and it is never decremented.
So after the task runs, the observed try number remains the same as it was when the task was running; only when there is a "new try" will the try number be incremented again.

One consequence of this change is, if users were "manually" running tasks (e.g. by calling ``ti.run()`` directly, or command line ``airflow tasks run``),
try number will no longer be incremented. Airflow assumes that tasks are always run after being scheduled by the scheduler, so we do not regard this as a breaking change.

``/logout`` endpoint in FAB Auth Manager is now CSRF protected (#40145)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``/logout`` endpoint's method in FAB Auth Manager has been changed from ``GET`` to ``POST`` in all existing
AuthViews (``AuthDBView``, ``AuthLDAPView``, ``AuthOAuthView``, ``AuthOIDView``, ``AuthRemoteUserView``), and
now includes CSRF protection to enhance security and prevent unauthorized logouts.

OpenTelemetry Traces for Apache Airflow (#37948).
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This new feature adds capability for Apache Airflow to emit 1) airflow system traces of scheduler,
triggerer, executor, processor 2) DAG run traces for deployed DAG runs in OpenTelemetry format. Previously, only metrics were supported which emitted metrics in OpenTelemetry.
This new feature will add richer data for users to use OpenTelemetry standard to emit and send their trace data to OTLP compatible endpoints.

Decorator for Task Flow ``(@skip_if, @run_if)`` to make it simple to apply whether or not to skip a Task. (#41116)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This feature adds a decorator to make it simple to skip a Task.

Using Multiple Executors Concurrently (#40701)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Previously known as hybrid executors, this new feature allows Airflow to use multiple executors concurrently. DAGs, or even individual tasks, can be configured
to use a specific executor that suits its needs best. A single DAG can contain tasks all using different executors. Please see the Airflow documentation for
more details. Note: This feature is still experimental. See `documentation on Executor <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/executor/index.html#using-multiple-executors-concurrently>`_ for a more detailed description.

Airflow 2.9.3 (2024-07-15)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Time unit for ``scheduled_duration`` and ``queued_duration`` changed (#37936)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``scheduled_duration`` and ``queued_duration`` metrics are now emitted in milliseconds instead of seconds.

By convention all statsd metrics should be emitted in milliseconds, this is later expected in e.g. ``prometheus`` statsd-exporter.


Support for OpenTelemetry Metrics is no longer "Experimental" (#40286)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Experimental support for OpenTelemetry was added in 2.7.0 since then fixes and improvements were added and now we announce the feature as stable.

Airflow 2.9.1 (2024-05-03)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stackdriver logging bugfix requires Google provider ``10.17.0`` or later (#38071)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you use Stackdriver logging, you must use Google provider version ``10.17.0`` or later. Airflow ``2.9.1`` now passes ``gcp_log_name`` to the ``StackdriverTaskHandler`` instead of ``name``, and this will fail on earlier provider versions.

This fixes a bug where the log name configured in ``[logging] remove_base_log_folder`` was overridden when Airflow configured logging, resulting in task logs going to the wrong destination.

Airflow 2.9.0 (2024-04-08)

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following Listener API methods are considered stable and can be used for production system (were experimental feature in older Airflow versions) (#36376):
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Lifecycle events:

- ``on_starting``
- ``before_stopping``

DagRun State Change Events:

- ``on_dag_run_running``
- ``on_dag_run_success``
- ``on_dag_run_failed``

TaskInstance State Change Events:

- ``on_task_instance_running``
- ``on_task_instance_success``
- ``on_task_instance_failed``

Support for Microsoft SQL-Server for Airflow Meta Database has been removed (#36514)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After `discussion <https://lists.apache.org/thread/r06j306hldg03g2my1pd4nyjxg78b3h4>`__
and a `voting process <https://lists.apache.org/thread/pgcgmhf6560k8jbsmz8nlyoxosvltph2>`__,
the Airflow's PMC members and Committers have reached a resolution to no longer maintain MsSQL as a
supported Database Backend.

As of Airflow 2.9.0 support of MsSQL has been removed for Airflow Database Backend.

A migration script which can help migrating the database *before* upgrading to Airflow 2.9.0 is available in
`airflow-mssql-migration repo on Github <https://github.com/apache/airflow-mssql-migration>`_.
Note that the migration script is provided without support and warranty.

This does not affect the existing provider packages (operators and hooks), DAGs can still access and process data from MsSQL.

Dataset URIs are now validated on input (#37005)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Datasets must use a URI that conform to rules laid down in AIP-60, and the value
will be automatically normalized when the DAG file is parsed. See
`documentation on Datasets <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.9.0/authoring-and-scheduling/datasets.html>`_ for
a more detailed description on the rules.

You may need to change your Dataset identifiers if they look like a URI, but are
used in a less mainstream way, such as relying on the URI's auth section, or
have a case-sensitive protocol name.

The method ``get_permitted_menu_items`` in ``BaseAuthManager`` has been renamed ``filter_permitted_menu_items`` (#37627)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Add REST API actions to Audit Log events (#37734)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Audit Log ``event`` name for REST API events will be prepended with ``api.`` or ``ui.``, depending on if it came from the Airflow UI or externally.

Official support for Python 3.12 (#38025)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are a few caveats though:

* Pendulum2 does not support Python 3.12. For Python 3.12 you need to use
  `Pendulum 3 <https://pendulum.eustace.io/blog/announcing-pendulum-3-0-0.html>`_

* Minimum SQLAlchemy version supported when Pandas is installed for Python 3.12 is ``1.4.36`` released in
  April 2022. Airflow 2.9.0 increases the minimum supported version of SQLAlchemy to ``1.4.36`` for all
  Python versions.

Not all Providers support Python 3.12. At the initial release of Airflow 2.9.0 the following providers
are released without support for Python 3.12:

  * ``apache.beam`` - pending on `Apache Beam support for 3.12 <https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29149>`_
  * ``papermill`` - pending on Releasing Python 3.12 compatible papermill client version
    `including this merged issue <https://github.com/nteract/papermill/pull/771>`_

Prevent large string objects from being stored in the Rendered Template Fields (#38094)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There's now a limit to the length of data that can be stored in the Rendered Template Fields.
The limit is set to 4096 characters. If the data exceeds this limit, it will be truncated. You can change this limit
by setting the ``[core]max_template_field_length`` configuration option in your airflow config.

Change xcom table column value type to longblob for MySQL backend (#38401)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Xcom table column ``value`` type has changed from ``blob`` to ``longblob``. This will allow you to store relatively big data in Xcom but process can take a significant amount of time if you have a lot of large data stored in Xcom.

To downgrade from revision: ``b4078ac230a1``, ensure that you don't have Xcom values larger than 65,535 bytes. Otherwise, you'll need to clean those rows or run ``airflow db clean xcom`` to clean the Xcom table.

Stronger validation for key parameter defaults in taskflow context variables (#38015)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As for the taskflow implementation in conjunction with context variable defaults invalid parameter orders can be
generated, it is now not accepted anymore (and validated) that taskflow functions are defined with defaults
other than ``None``. If you have done this before you most likely will see a broken DAG and a error message like
``Error message: Context key parameter my_param can't have a default other than None``.

Airflow 2.8.2 (2024-02-26)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``allowed_deserialization_classes`` flag now follows a glob pattern (#36147).
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For example if one wants to add the class ``airflow.tests.custom_class`` to the
``allowed_deserialization_classes`` list, it can be done by writing the full class
name (``airflow.tests.custom_class``) or a pattern such as the ones used in glob
search (e.g., ``airflow.*``, ``airflow.tests.*``).

If you currently use a custom regexp path make sure to rewrite it as a glob pattern.

Alternatively, if you still wish to match it as a regexp pattern, add it under the new
list ``allowed_deserialization_classes_regexp`` instead.

The audit_logs permissions have been updated for heightened security (#37501).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This was done under the policy that we do not want users like Viewer, Ops,
and other users apart from Admin to have access to audit_logs. The intention behind
this change is to restrict users with less permissions from viewing user details
like First Name, Email etc. from the audit_logs when they are not permitted to.

The impact of this change is that the existing users with non admin rights won't be able
to view or access the audit_logs, both from the Browse tab or from the DAG run.

``AirflowTimeoutError`` is no longer ``except`` by default through ``Exception`` (#35653).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``AirflowTimeoutError`` is now inheriting ``BaseException`` instead of
``AirflowException``->``Exception``.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy

This prevents code catching ``Exception`` from accidentally
catching ``AirflowTimeoutError`` and continuing to run.
``AirflowTimeoutError`` is an explicit intent to cancel the task, and should not
be caught in attempts to handle the error and return some default value.

Catching ``AirflowTimeoutError`` is still possible by explicitly ``except``ing
``AirflowTimeoutError`` or ``BaseException``.
This is discouraged, as it may allow the code to continue running even after
such cancellation requests.
Code that previously depended on performing strict cleanup in every situation
after catching ``Exception`` is advised to use ``finally`` blocks or
context managers. To perform only the cleanup and then automatically
re-raise the exception.
See similar considerations about catching ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in
https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt

Airflow 2.8.1 (2024-01-19)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Target version for core dependency ``pendulum`` package set to 3 (#36281).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Support for pendulum 2.1.2 will be saved for a while, presumably until the next feature version of Airflow.
It is advised to upgrade user code to use pendulum 3 as soon as possible.

Pendulum 3 introduced some subtle incompatibilities that you might rely on in your code - for example
default rendering of dates is missing ``T`` in the rendered date representation, which is not ISO8601
compliant. If you rely on the default rendering of dates, you might need to adjust your code to use
``isoformat()`` method to render dates in ISO8601 format.

Airflow packaging specification follows modern Python packaging standards (#36537).
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
We standardized Airflow dependency configuration to follow latest development in Python packaging by
using ``pyproject.toml``. Airflow is now compliant with those accepted PEPs:

* `PEP-440 Version Identification and Dependency Specification <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`__
* `PEP-517 A build-system independent format for source trees <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/>`__
* `PEP-518 Specifying Minimum Build System Requirements for Python Projects <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/>`__
* `PEP-561 Distributing and Packaging Type Information <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/>`__
* `PEP-621 Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/>`__
* `PEP-660 Editable installs for pyproject.toml based builds (wheel based) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0660/>`__
* `PEP-685 Comparison of extra names for optional distribution dependencies <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0685/>`__

Also we implement multiple license files support coming from Draft, not yet accepted (but supported by ``hatchling``) PEP:
* `PEP 639 Improving License Clarity with Better Package Metadata <https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/>`__

This has almost no noticeable impact on users if they are using modern Python packaging and development tools, generally
speaking Airflow should behave as it did before when installing it from PyPI and it should be much easier to install
it for development purposes using ``pip install -e ".[devel]"``.

The differences from the user side are:

* Airflow extras now get extras normalized to ``-`` (following PEP-685) instead of ``_`` and ``.``
  (as it was before in some extras). When you install airflow with such extras (for example ``dbt.core`` or
  ``all_dbs``) you should use ``-`` instead of ``_`` and ``.``.

In most modern tools this will work in backwards-compatible way, but in some old version of those tools you might need to
replace ``_`` and ``.`` with ``-``. You can also get warnings that the extra you are installing does not exist - but usually
this warning is harmless and the extra is installed anyway. It is, however, recommended to change to use ``-`` in extras in your dependency
specifications for all Airflow extras.

* Released airflow package does not contain ``devel``, ``devel-*``, ``doc`` and ``docs-gen`` extras.
  Those extras are only available when you install Airflow from sources in ``--editable`` mode. This is
  because those extras are only used for development and documentation building purposes and are not needed
  when you install Airflow for production use. Those dependencies had unspecified and varying behaviour for
  released packages anyway and you were not supposed to use them in released packages.

* The ``all`` and ``all-*`` extras were not always working correctly when installing Airflow using constraints
  because they were also considered as development-only dependencies. With this change, those dependencies are
  now properly handling constraints and they will install properly with constraints, pulling the right set
  of providers and dependencies when constraints are used.

Graphviz dependency is now an optional one, not required one (#36647).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The ``graphviz`` dependency has been problematic as Airflow required dependency - especially for
ARM-based installations. Graphviz packages require binary graphviz libraries - which is already a
limitation, but they also require to install graphviz Python bindings to be build and installed.
This does not work for older Linux installation but - more importantly - when you try to install
Graphviz libraries for Python 3.8, 3.9 for ARM M1 MacBooks, the packages fail to install because
Python bindings compilation for M1 can only work for Python 3.10+.

This is not a breaking change technically - the CLIs to render the DAGs is still there and IF you
already have graphviz installed, it will continue working as it did before. The only problem when it
does not work is where you do not have graphviz installed it will raise an error and inform that you need it.

Graphviz will remain to be installed for most users:

* the Airflow Image will still contain graphviz library, because
  it is added there as extra
* when previous version of Airflow has been installed already, then
  graphviz library is already installed there and Airflow will
  continue working as it did

The only change will be a new installation of new version of Airflow from the scratch, where graphviz will
need to be specified as extra or installed separately in order to enable DAG rendering option.

Airflow 2.8.0 (2023-12-18)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Raw HTML code in DAG docs and DAG params descriptions is disabled by default (#35460)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
To ensure that no malicious javascript can be injected with DAG descriptions or trigger UI forms by DAG authors
a new parameter ``webserver.allow_raw_html_descriptions`` was added with default value of ``False``.
If you trust your DAG authors code and want to allow using raw HTML in DAG descriptions and params, you can restore the previous
behavior by setting the configuration value to ``True``.

To ensure Airflow is secure by default, the raw HTML support in trigger UI has been super-seeded by markdown support via
the ``description_md`` attribute. If you have been using ``description_html`` please migrate to ``description_md``.
The ``custom_html_form`` is now deprecated.

Airflow 2.7.1 (2023-09-07)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CronTriggerTimetable is now less aggressive when trying to skip a run (#33404)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When setting ``catchup=False``, CronTriggerTimetable no longer skips a run if
the scheduler does not query the timetable immediately after the previous run
has been triggered.

This should not affect scheduling in most cases, but can change the behaviour if
a DAG is paused-unpaused to manually skip a run. Previously, the timetable (with
``catchup=False``) would only start a run after a DAG is unpaused, but with this
change, the scheduler would try to look at little bit back to schedule the
previous run that covers a part of the period when the DAG was paused. This
means you will need to keep a DAG paused longer (namely, for the entire cron
period to pass) to really skip a run.

Note that this is also the behaviour exhibited by various other cron-based
scheduling tools, such as ``anacron``.

``conf.set()`` becomes case insensitive to match ``conf.get()`` behavior (#33452)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Also, ``conf.get()`` will now break if used with non-string parameters.

``conf.set(section, key, value)`` used to be case sensitive, i.e. ``conf.set("SECTION", "KEY", value)``
and ``conf.set("section", "key", value)`` were stored as two distinct configurations.
This was inconsistent with the behavior of ``conf.get(section, key)``, which was always converting the section and key to lower case.

As a result, configuration options set with upper case characters in the section or key were unreachable.
That's why we are now converting section and key to lower case in ``conf.set`` too.

We also changed a bit the behavior of ``conf.get()``. It used to allow objects that are not strings in the section or key.
Doing this will now result in an exception. For instance, ``conf.get("section", 123)`` needs to be replaced with ``conf.get("section", "123")``.

Airflow 2.7.0 (2023-08-18)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Remove Python 3.7 support (#30963)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
As of now, Python 3.7 is no longer supported by the Python community.
Therefore, to use Airflow 2.7.0, you must ensure your Python version is
either 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11.

Old Graph View is removed (#32958)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The old Graph View is removed. The new Graph View is the default view now.

The trigger UI form is skipped in web UI if no parameters are defined in a DAG (#33351)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are using ``dag_run.conf`` dictionary and web UI JSON entry to run your DAG you should either:

* `Add params to your DAG <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/params.html#use-params-to-provide-a-trigger-ui-form>`_
* Enable the new configuration ``show_trigger_form_if_no_params`` to bring back old behaviour

The "db init", "db upgrade" commands and "[database] load_default_connections" configuration options are deprecated (#33136).
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Instead, you should use "airflow db migrate" command to create or upgrade database. This command will not create default connections.
In order to create default connections you need to run "airflow connections create-default-connections" explicitly,
after running "airflow db migrate".

In case of SMTP SSL connection, the context now uses the "default" context (#33070)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The "default" context is Python's ``default_ssl_contest`` instead of previously used "none". The
``default_ssl_context`` provides a balance between security and compatibility but in some cases,
when certificates are old, self-signed or misconfigured, it might not work. This can be configured
by setting "ssl_context" in "email" configuration of Airflow.

Setting it to "none" brings back the "none" setting that was used in Airflow 2.6 and before,
but it is not recommended due to security reasons ad this setting disables validation of certificates and allows MITM attacks.

Disable default allowing the testing of connections in UI, API and CLI(#32052)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
For security reasons, the test connection functionality is disabled by default across Airflow UI,
API and CLI. The availability of the functionality can be controlled by the
``test_connection`` flag in the ``core`` section of the Airflow
configuration (``airflow.cfg``). It can also be controlled by the
environment variable ``AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION``.

The following values are accepted for this config param:
1. ``Disabled``: Disables the test connection functionality and
disables the Test Connection button in the UI.

This is also the default value set in the Airflow configuration.
2. ``Enabled``: Enables the test connection functionality and
activates the Test Connection button in the UI.

3. ``Hidden``: Disables the test connection functionality and
hides the Test Connection button in UI.

For more information on capabilities of users, see the documentation:
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/security_model.html#capabilities-of-authenticated-ui-users
It is strongly advised to **not** enable the feature until you make sure that only
highly trusted UI/API users have "edit connection" permissions.

The ``xcomEntries`` API disables support for the ``deserialize`` flag by default (#32176)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
For security reasons, the ``/dags/*/dagRuns/*/taskInstances/*/xcomEntries/*``
API endpoint now disables the ``deserialize`` option to deserialize arbitrary
XCom values in the webserver. For backward compatibility, server admins may set
the ``[api] enable_xcom_deserialize_support`` config to *True* to enable the
flag and restore backward compatibility.

However, it is strongly advised to **not** enable the feature, and perform
deserialization at the client side instead.

Change of the default Celery application name (#32526)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Default name of the Celery application changed from ``airflow.executors.celery_executor`` to ``airflow.providers.celery.executors.celery_executor``.

You should change both your configuration and Health check command to use the new name:
  * in configuration (``celery_app_name`` configuration in ``celery`` section) use ``airflow.providers.celery.executors.celery_executor``
  * in your Health check command use ``airflow.providers.celery.executors.celery_executor.app``


The default value for ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` is changed from 512 to 16 (#32572)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This change is expected to make the Scheduler more responsive.

``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` needs to be lower than ``core.parallelism``.
If both were left to their default value previously, the effective default value of ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` was 32
(because it was capped at ``core.parallelism``).

To keep the behavior as close as possible to the old config, one can set ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query = 0``,
in which case it'll always use the value of ``core.parallelism``.

Some executors have been moved to corresponding providers (#32767)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In order to use the executors, you need to install the providers:

* for Celery executors you need to install ``apache-airflow-providers-celery`` package >= 3.3.0
* for Kubernetes executors you need to install ``apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes`` package >= 7.4.0
* For Dask executors you need to install ``apache-airflow-providers-daskexecutor`` package in any version

You can achieve it also by installing airflow with ``[celery]``, ``[cncf.kubernetes]``, ``[daskexecutor]`` extras respectively.

Users who base their images on the ``apache/airflow`` reference image (not slim) should be unaffected - the base
reference image comes with all the three providers installed.

Improvement Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL only improvement: Added index on taskinstance table (#30762)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This index seems to have great positive effect in a setup with tens of millions such rows.

Airflow 2.6.1 (2023-05-16)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clarifications of the external Health Check mechanism and using ``Job`` classes (#31277).
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the past SchedulerJob and other ``*Job`` classes are known to have been used to perform
external health checks for Airflow components. Those are, however, Airflow DB ORM related classes.
The DB models and database structure of Airflow are considered as internal implementation detail, following
`public interface <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/public-airflow-interface.html>`_).
Therefore, they should not be used for external health checks. Instead, you should use the
``airflow jobs check`` CLI command (introduced in Airflow 2.1) for that purpose.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- Fix calculation of health check threshold for SchedulerJob (#31277)
- Fix timestamp parse failure for k8s executor pod tailing (#31175)
- Make sure that DAG processor job row has filled value in ``job_type`` column (#31182)

Airflow 2.6.0 (2023-04-30)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default permissions of file task handler log directories and files has been changed to "owner + group" writeable (#29506).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Default setting handles case where impersonation is needed and both users (airflow and the impersonated user)
have the same group set as main group. Previously the default was also other-writeable and the user might choose
to use the other-writeable setting if they wish by configuring ``file_task_handler_new_folder_permissions``
and ``file_task_handler_new_file_permissions`` in ``logging`` section.

SLA callbacks no longer add files to the dag processor manager's queue (#30076)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This stops SLA callbacks from keeping the dag processor manager permanently busy. It means reduced CPU,
and fixes issues where SLAs stop the system from seeing changes to existing dag files. Additional metrics added to help track queue state.

The ``cleanup()`` method in BaseTrigger is now defined as asynchronous (following async/await) pattern (#30152).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is potentially a breaking change for any custom trigger implementations that override the ``cleanup()``
method and uses synchronous code, however using synchronous operations in cleanup was technically wrong,
because the method was executed in the main loop of the Triggerer and it was introducing unnecessary delays
impacting other triggers. The change is unlikely to affect any existing trigger implementations.

The gauge ``scheduler.tasks.running`` no longer exist (#30374)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The gauge has never been working and its value has always been 0. Having an accurate
value for this metric is complex so it has been decided that removing this gauge makes
more sense than fixing it with no certainty of the correctness of its value.

Consolidate handling of tasks stuck in queued under new ``task_queued_timeout`` config (#30375)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Logic for handling tasks stuck in the queued state has been consolidated, and the all configurations
responsible for timing out stuck queued tasks have been deprecated and merged into
``[scheduler] task_queued_timeout``. The configurations that have been deprecated are
``[kubernetes] worker_pods_pending_timeout``, ``[celery] stalled_task_timeout``, and
``[celery] task_adoption_timeout``. If any of these configurations are set, the longest timeout will be
respected. For example, if ``[celery] stalled_task_timeout`` is 1200, and ``[scheduler] task_queued_timeout``
is 600, Airflow will set ``[scheduler] task_queued_timeout`` to 1200.

Improvement Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Display only the running configuration in configurations view (#28892)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The configurations view now only displays the running configuration. Previously, the default configuration
was displayed at the top but it was not obvious whether this default configuration was overridden or not.
Subsequently, the non-documented endpoint ``/configuration?raw=true`` is deprecated and will be removed in
Airflow 3.0. The HTTP response now returns an additional ``Deprecation`` header. The ``/config`` endpoint on
the REST API is the standard way to fetch Airflow configuration programmatically.

Explicit skipped states list for ExternalTaskSensor (#29933)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
ExternalTaskSensor now has an explicit ``skipped_states`` list

Miscellaneous Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handle OverflowError on exponential backoff in next_run_calculation (#28172)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Maximum retry task delay is set to be 24h (86400s) by default. You can change it globally via ``core.max_task_retry_delay``
parameter.

Move Hive macros to the provider (#28538)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Hive Macros (``hive.max_partition``, ``hive.closest_ds_partition``) are available only when Hive Provider is
installed. Please install Hive Provider > 5.1.0 when using those macros.

Updated app to support configuring the caching hash method for FIPS v2 (#30675)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Various updates for FIPS-compliance when running Airflow in Python 3.9+. This includes a new webserver option, ``caching_hash_method``,
for changing the default flask caching method.

In case of API calls, it was possible that "+" passed as part of the date-time fields were not URL-encoded, and
such date-time fields could pass validation. Such date-time parameters should now be URL-encoded (as ``%2B``).

In case of parameters, we still allow IS8601-compliant date-time (so for example it is possible that
' ' was used instead of ``T`` separating date from time and no timezone was specified) but we raise
deprecation warning.

Default for ``[webserver] expose_hostname`` changed to ``False`` (#29547)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default for ``[webserver] expose_hostname`` has been set to ``False``, instead of ``True``. This means administrators must opt-in to expose webserver hostnames to end users.

Airflow 2.5.0 (2022-12-02)
--------------------------

Significant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``airflow dags test`` no longer performs a backfill job (#26400)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In order to make ``airflow dags test`` more useful as a testing and debugging tool, we no
longer run a backfill job and instead run a "local task runner". Users can still backfill
their DAGs using the ``airflow dags backfill`` command.

Airflow config section ``kubernetes`` renamed to ``kubernetes_executor`` (#26873)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

KubernetesPodOperator no longer considers any core kubernetes config params, so this section now only applies to kubernetes executor. Renaming it reduces potential for confusion.

``AirflowException`` is now thrown as soon as any dependent tasks of ExternalTaskSensor fails (#27190)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``ExternalTaskSensor`` no longer hangs indefinitely when ``failed_states`` is set, an ``execute_date_fn`` is used, and some but not all of the dependent tasks fail.
Instead, an ``AirflowException`` is thrown as soon as any of the dependent tasks fail.
Any code handling this failure in addition to timeouts should move to caching the ``AirflowException`` ``BaseClass`` and not only the ``AirflowSensorTimeout`` subclass.

The Airflow config option ``scheduler.deactivate_stale_dags_interval`` has been renamed to ``scheduler.parsing_cleanup_interval`` (#27828).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The old option will continue to work but will issue deprecation warnings, and will be removed entirely in Airflow 3.
