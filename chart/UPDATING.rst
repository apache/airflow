Updating the Airflow Helm Chart
===============================

The following documents any backwards-incompatible changes in the Airflow Helm chart and
assists users migrating to a new version.

.. I'm glad you want to write a new note. Remember that this note is intended for users.
   Make sure it contains the following information:

.. - [ ] Previous behaviors
   - [ ] New behaviors
   - [ ] If possible, a simple example of how to migrate. This may include a simple code example.
   - [ ] If possible, the benefit for the user after migration e.g. "we want to make these changes to unify class names."
   - [ ] If possible, the reason for the change, which adds more context to that interested, e.g. reference for Airflow Improvement Proposal.

.. More tips can be found in the guide:
   https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation

Run ``helm repo update`` before upgrading the chart to the latest version.

Airflow Helm Chart 1.3.0 (dev)
------------------------------

Default Airflow image is updated to ``2.2.1``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default Airflow image that is used with the Chart is now ``2.2.1`` (which is Python ``3.7``), previously it was ``2.1.4`` (which is Python ``3.6``).

The triggerer component requires Python ``3.7``. If you require Python ``3.6`` and Airflow ``2.2.0`` or later, use a ``3.6`` based image and set ``triggerer.enabled=False`` in your values.

Resources made configurable for ``airflow-run-airflow-migrations`` job
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Now it's possible to set resources requests and limits for migration job through ``migrateDatabaseJob.resources`` value.

Airflow Helm Chart 1.2.0
------------------------

``ingress.web.host`` and ``ingress.flower.host`` parameters have been renamed and data type changed
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``ingress.web.host`` and ``ingress.flower.host`` parameters have been renamed to ``ingress.web.hosts`` and ``ingress.flower.hosts``, respectively. Their types have been changed from a string to an array of strings.

The old parameter names will continue to work, however support for them will be removed in a future release so please update your values file.

Default Airflow version is updated to ``2.1.4``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default Airflow version that is installed with the Chart is now ``2.1.4``, previously it was ``2.1.2``.

Removed ``ingress.flower.precedingPaths`` and ``ingress.flower.succeedingPaths`` parameters
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``ingress.flower.precedingPaths`` and ``ingress.flower.succeedingPaths`` parameters have been removed as they had previously had no effect on rendered YAML output.

Change of default ``path`` on Ingress
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

With the move to support the stable Kubernetes Ingress API the default path has been changed from being unset to ``/``. For most Ingress controllers this should not change the behavior of the resulting Ingress resource.

Airflow Helm Chart 1.1.0
------------------------

Run ``helm repo update`` before upgrading the chart to the latest version.

Default Airflow version is updated to ``2.1.2``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The default Airflow version that is installed with the Chart is now ``2.1.2``, previously it was ``2.0.2``.

Helm 2 no longer supported
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This chart has dropped support for `Helm 2 as it has been deprecated <https://helm.sh/blog/helm-v2-deprecation-timeline/>`__ and no longer receiving security updates since November 2020.

``webserver.extraNetworkPolicies`` and ``flower.extraNetworkPolicies`` parameters have been renamed
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``webserver.extraNetworkPolicies`` and ``flower.extraNetworkPolicies`` have been renamed to ``webserver.networkPolicy.ingress.from`` and ``flower.networkPolicy.ingress.from``, respectively. Their values and behavior are the same.

The old parameter names will continue to work, however support for them will be removed in a future release so please update your values file.

Removed ``dags.gitSync.root``, ``dags.gitSync.dest``, and ``dags.gitSync.excludeWebserver`` parameters
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``dags.gitSync.root`` and ``dags.gitSync.dest`` parameters did not provide any useful behaviors to chart users so they have been removed.
If you have them set in your values file you can safely remove them.

The ``dags.gitSync.excludeWebserver`` parameter was mistakenly included in the charts ``values.schema.json``. If you have it set in your values file,
you can safely remove it.

``nodeSelector``, ``affinity`` and ``tolerations`` on ``migrateDatabaseJob`` and ``createUserJob`` jobs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``migrateDatabaseJob`` and ``createUserJob`` jobs were incorrectly using the ``webserver``'s ``nodeSelector``, ``affinity``
and ``tolerations`` (if set). Each job is now configured separately.
