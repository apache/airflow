Customizing Labels for Pods
---------------------------

The Helm chart allows you to customize labels for your Airflow objects. You can set global labels that apply to all objects and pods defined in the chart, as well as component-specific labels for individual Airflow components.

Global Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Global labels can be set using the ``labels`` parameter in your values file. These labels will be applied to all Airflow objects and pods defined in the chart:

.. code-block:: yaml

    labels:
      environment: production

Component-Specific Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also set specific labels for individual Airflow components. These labels will be merged with the global labels, with component-specific labels taking precedence.

For example, to add specific labels to different components:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Global labels applied to all pods
    labels:
      environment: production

    # Scheduler specific labels
    scheduler:
      labels:
        role: scheduler

    # Worker specific labels
    workers:
      labels:
        role: worker

    # Webserver specific labels
    webserver:
      labels:
        role: ui

.. note::
    Component-specific labels take precedence over global labels when there are conflicts. This allows you to override global labels for specific components when needed.
