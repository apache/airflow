``workers.persistence`` section is now deprecated in favor of ``workers.celery.persistence``.

Along the upgrade of Helm Chart version, change the configuration of values in section ``workers.persistence`` to ``workers.celery.persistence`` section or unset all values under ``workers.celery.persistence`` to preserve previous behaviour of the Helm Chart.
