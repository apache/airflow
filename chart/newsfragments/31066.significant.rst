Support naming customization on helm chart resources, some resources may be renamed during upgrade

This is a new opt-in switch ``useStandardNaming``, for backwards compatibility, to leverage the standard naming convention, which allows full use of fullnameOverride and nameOverride in all resources.

Only the following resources will be renamed using default of ``useStandardNaming=false``:
- ConfigMap {release}-airflow-config to {release}-config
- Secret {release}-airflow-metadata to {release}-metadata
- Secret {release}-airflow-result-backend to {release}-result-backend


If you do not change ``useStandardNaming`` or ``fullnameOverride`` after upgrade, you can proceed as usual and no unexpected behaviours will be presented.
