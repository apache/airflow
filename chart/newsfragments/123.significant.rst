``workers.safeToEvict`` default changed to False

The default for ``workers.safeToEvict`` now defaults to False. This is a safer default
as it prevents the nodes workers are running on from being scaled down by the
[K8s Cluster Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cluster-autoscaling/#cluster-autoscaler).
If you would like to retain the previous behavior, you can set this config to True.
