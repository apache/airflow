Support for Multiple Celery Worker Sets in the Helm Chart

Description
The change introduces support for advanced Celery Workers topologies to Apache Airflow Helm Chart, enabling more flexible resource allocation and precise autoscaling configurations.

Why is this needed?
1. Flexible Worker Topologies
As Airflow adoption grows, platform teams often need to route tasks exclusively to specialized worker sets (e.g., GPU-optimized, Memory-optimized) without maintaining a generic ``default`` worker.

Enhancement: The new ``workers.celery.enableDefault`` flag allows users to configure a deployment consisting only of specialized worker sets defined in ``workers.celery.sets`` section. This provides flexibility for teams to design their workers architecture exactly as needed.
2. Multi-Queue Autoscaling Support
Complex workflows often require a single worker set to handle tasks from multiple specific queues (e.g., queue: "high-priority,vip").

Enhancement: This PR updates the KEDA ScaledObject generation to support comma-separated queue lists. By using the ``SQL IN (...)`` clause, we ensure that KEDA scales worker sets based on the precise aggregate workload of all their assigned queues.
3. Granular Configuration Overrides
Different worker sets may require different operational strategies within the same cluster.

Enhancement: This change allows for overwrite of any currently available workers configuration per worker set. For example, a user can enable KEDA globally, but explicitly disable it for a specific worker set that requires a static number of replicas.
Changes
New Feature: Added ``workers.celery.enableDefault`` (default: true) to values.yaml.
