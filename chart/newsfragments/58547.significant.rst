Support for Multiple Celery Worker Sets in the Helm Chart

Helm chart behavior related to Celery worker configuration has changed.
Multiple worker sets can now be configured, which affects how worker sets are rendered and scaled.
Users upgrading the chart should review their Helm values if they relied on the previous
single worker behavior.

See `Helm PR #58547 <https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/58547>`_ for details.
