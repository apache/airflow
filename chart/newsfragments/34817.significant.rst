The helm chart is now using a newer version of ``bitnami/postgresql`` dependency

The version of ``bitnami/postgresql`` subchart upgraded from ``12.10.0`` to ``13.2.24``.
The version of ``PostgreSQL`` binaries upgraded from ``11`` to ``16.1.0``.

The change requires existing ``bitnami/postgresql`` subchart users to perform manual major version upgrade using ``pg_dumpall`` or ``pg_upgrade``.

As a reminder, it is recommended to `set up an external database <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/production-guide.html#database>`_ in production.
