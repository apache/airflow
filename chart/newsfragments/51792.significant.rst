StatsD metrics aggregation now supports configurable TTL-enabled LRU cache to prevent memory growth in long-running daemons.

The Helm Chart now includes new configuration options for StatsD aggregation management:

* ``statsd.cacheType`` - Enable TTL-enabled ``lru`` cache or ``random`` cache for metrics aggregation (default: ``lru``)
* ``statsd.cacheSize`` - Maximum number of metrics to cache (default: ``1000``)
* ``statsd.ttl`` - Time-to-live for cached metrics in seconds (``0s`` is TTL disabled) (default: ``0s``)

This feature addresses uncontrolled memory growth in StatsD daemons by automatically cleaning up stale or unused metric entries. When enabled, the cache uses both LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction and TTL (Time To Live) expiration to manage memory usage effectively.

To maintain backward compatibility, the values are kept default values from ``StatsD`` Users experiencing memory growth issues with StatsD can enable this feature by setting ``statsd.cache: true`` in their Helm values.
