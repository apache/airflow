# This autodetection of PYTHON_VERSION works in this sequence:
#
#    1) When running builds on DockerHub we cannot pass different environment
#       variables there, so we detect python version based on the image
#       name being build (airflow:master-python3.7 -> PYTHON_VERSION=3.7).
#       DockerHub adds index.docker.io in front of the image name.
#
#    2) When running builds on Travis CI. We use python version determined
#       from default python3 version available on the path. This way we
#       do not have to specify PYTHON_VERSION separately in each job.
#       We just specify which host python version is used for that job.
#       This makes a nice UI experience where you see python version in
#       Travis UI.
#
#    3) Running builds locally via scripts where we can pass PYTHON_VERSION
#       as environment variable.
#
#    4) Running builds locally for the first time with Breeze. By default
#       we determine the version based on default python3 version we have
#       in the host system (3.5, 3.6 or 3.7) and we use this one.
#
#    5) Selecting python version with Breeze's --python switch. This will
#       override python version but it will also store the last used version
#       of python in .build directory so that it is automatically used next
#       time.
