# Airflow OpenAPI clients

This directory contains definition of Airflow OpenAPI client packages.

Supported languages:

* [Python](https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python) generated through `./gen/python.sh`.

## Generating client code

To generate the client code using dockerized breeze environment, run (at the Airflow source root directory):

```bash
breeze release-management prepare-python-client --package-format both
```

The client source code generation uses OpenAPI generator image, generation of packages is done using Hatch.
By default, packages are generated in a dockerized Hatch environment, but you can also use a local one by
setting `--use-local-hatch` flag.

```bash
breeze release-management prepare-python-client --package-format both --use-local-hatch
```

## Browsing the generated source code

The generated source code is not committed to Airflow repository, but when releasing the package, Airflow
team also stores generated client code in the
[Airflow Client Python repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python).
