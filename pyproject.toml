# this problem on our end in issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/30764. Until then we need
# to use one of the following workarounds locally for editable installs:
# 1) Pin setuptools <= 63.4.3 below in the [build-system] section.
# 2) Include your airflow source code directory in PYTHONPATH.
