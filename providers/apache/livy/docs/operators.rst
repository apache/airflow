Apache Livy Operators
=====================

Apache Livy is a service that enables easy interaction with a Spark cluster over a REST interface.
It enables easy submission of Spark jobs or snippets of Spark code, synchronous or asynchronous result retrieval,
as well as Spark Context management, all via a simple REST interface or an RPC client library.

LivyOperator
------------

This operator wraps the Apache Livy batch REST API, allowing to submit a Spark application to the underlying cluster.
