Generate JWT token with Keycloak auth manager
=============================================

.. note::
    This guide only applies if your environment is configured with Keycloak auth manager.

In order to use the :doc:`Airflow public API <apache-airflow:stable-rest-api-ref>`, you need a JWT token for authentication.
You can then include this token in your Airflow public API requests.
To generate a JWT token, use the ``Create Token`` API in :doc:`/api-ref/token-api-ref`.

Example
'''''''

.. code-block:: bash

    ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:8080"
    curl -X 'POST' \
        "${ENDPOINT_URL}/auth/token" \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
        "username": "<username>",
        "password": "<password>"
        }'

This process will return a token that you can use in the Airflow public API requests.
