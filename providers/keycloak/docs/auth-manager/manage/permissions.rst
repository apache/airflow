==================================================
Manage user permissions with Keycloak auth manager
==================================================

You can set-up and manage user permissions with Keycloak auth manager in different ways:

1. Using Airflow CLI
2. Using Keycloak console

With Airflow CLI
----------------
Setting up the permissions can be done using CLI commands.
They can create the permissions and needed resources easily.

There are two options to create the permissions:

* Create all permissions (Scopes, Resources, Permissions) in one go using one CLI command
* Create all permissions (Scopes, Resources, Permissions) step-by-step using the CLI commands

CLI commands take the following parameters:

* ``--username``: Keycloak admin username
* ``--password``: Keycloak admin password
* ``--user-realm``: Keycloak user realm
* ``--client-id``: Keycloak client id (default: admin-cli)

Please check the `Keycloak auth manager CLI </cli-refs.html>`_ documentation for more information about accepted parameters.

One-go creation of permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a single command do all the magic for you.

This command will create scopes, resources and permissions in one-go.

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow keycloak create-all

Step-by-step creation of permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we need to create scopes for the permissions. These scopes later will be used in Keycloak authorization [1].

This command will create scopes for certain types of permissions.

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow keycloak create-scopes

This command will create resources for certain types of permissions.

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow keycloak create-resources

Finally, with the command below, we create the permissions using the previously created scopes and resources.

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow keycloak create-permissions

This will create

* read-only permissions
* admin permissions
* user permissions
* operations permissions

More resources about permissions can be found in the official documentation of Keycloak:
