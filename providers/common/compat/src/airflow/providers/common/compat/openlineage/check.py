    Enforce minimum version requirements for OpenLineage provider or client.

    Some providers, such as Snowflake and DBT Cloud, do not require an OpenLineage provider but may
    offer optional features that depend on it. These features are generally available starting
    from a specific version of the OpenLineage provider or client. This decorator helps ensure compatibility,
    preventing import errors and providing clear logs about version requirements.

    Args:
        provider_min_version: Optional minimum version requirement for apache-airflow-providers-openlineage
        client_min_version: Optional minimum version requirement for openlineage-python

    Raises:
        ValueError: If neither `provider_min_version` nor `client_min_version` is provided.
        TypeError: If the decorator is used without parentheses (e.g., `@require_openlineage_version`).
