Changelog
---------

1.3.1
.....

This release fixes a few errors that were introduced in common.sql operator while refactoring common parts:

* ``_process_output`` method in ``SQLExecuteQueryOperator`` has now consistent semantics and typing, it
  can also modify the returned (and stored in XCom) values in the operators that derive from the
  ``SQLExecuteQueryOperator``).
* descriptions of all returned results are stored as descriptions property in the DBApiHook
* last description of the cursor whether to return single query results values are now exposed in
  DBApiHook via last_description property.

Lack of consistency in the operator caused ``1.3.0`` to be yanked - the ``1.3.0`` should not be used - if
you have ``1.3.0`` installed, upgrade to ``1.3.1``.
