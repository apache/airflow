``LoggingToolset``
==================

:class:`~airflow.providers.common.ai.toolsets.logging.LoggingToolset` is a
``WrapperToolset`` that intercepts ``call_tool()`` to log each tool invocation
in real time. ``AgentOperator`` applies it automatically (see
``enable_tool_logging``), but you can also use it directly with any pydantic-ai
``Agent``:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.providers.common.ai.toolsets.logging import LoggingToolset
    from airflow.providers.common.ai.toolsets.sql import SQLToolset

    sql_toolset = SQLToolset(db_conn_id="my_db")
    logged_toolset = LoggingToolset(wrapped=sql_toolset, logger=my_logger)

Each tool call produces two INFO log lines (name + timing) and optional
DEBUG-level argument logging. Exceptions are logged and re-raised.
