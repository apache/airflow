# Common AI Provider — Agent Instructions

This provider wraps [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to connect Airflow pipelines to LLMs.
The hook is a thin bridge between Airflow connections and pydantic-ai's model/provider abstractions.

## Design Principles

- **Delegate to pydantic-ai.** pydantic-ai supports 20+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure,
  Bedrock, Ollama, etc.) via `infer_model()` and provider classes like `AzureProvider`, `BedrockProvider`.
  Do not re-implement provider-specific logic that pydantic-ai handles.
  Before writing new code, check: https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/
- **Keep the hook thin.** `PydanticAIHook.get_conn()` maps Airflow connection fields to pydantic-ai
  constructors. That is the hook's entire job. Do not add abstraction layers (builders, factories,
  registries, Protocols) on top of pydantic-ai's own abstractions.
- **No premature abstraction.** Do not add Protocols, builder patterns, or plugin systems for a single
  code path. Wait until there are 3+ concrete use cases before introducing an abstraction.
- **Operators stay focused.** Each operator does one thing: `LLMOperator` (prompt → output),
  `LLMBranchOperator` (prompt → branch decision), `LLMSQLOperator` (prompt → validated SQL).

## Adding Support for a New LLM Provider

If pydantic-ai already supports the provider (check [models docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/)):

1. **Do nothing in this package.** Users set the `provider:model` string in their connection
   (e.g. `azure:gpt-4o`, `bedrock:anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) and the hook resolves it
   via `infer_model()`.
2. If the provider needs credentials beyond `api_key` and `base_url`, add a branch in
   `get_conn()` using pydantic-ai's own provider class (e.g. `AzureProvider`).
3. Update the connection form docs if new fields are needed.

If pydantic-ai does *not* support the provider, contribute upstream to pydantic-ai rather than
building a wrapper here.

## Security

- **No dynamic imports from connection extras.** Never use `importlib.import_module()` on
  user-provided strings from connection fields. Connection extras are editable by users with
  connection-edit permissions and must not become a code execution vector.
- **SQL validation is on by default.** `LLMSQLOperator` validates generated SQL via AST parsing.
  Do not disable this default.

## Pitfalls

- Do not construct raw provider SDK clients (e.g. `openai.AsyncAzureOpenAI`) — use pydantic-ai's
  provider classes which handle client construction internally.
- Do not add provider-specific connection types. The single `pydantic_ai` connection type works for
  all providers via the `provider:model` format.
- Use `from airflow.providers.common.compat.sdk import ...` for SDK imports, never
  `from airflow.sdk import ...` directly.
