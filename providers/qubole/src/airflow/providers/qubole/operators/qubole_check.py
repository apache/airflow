    """
    Performs checks against Qubole Commands. ``QuboleCheckOperator`` expects
    a command that will be executed on QDS.
    By default, each value on first row of the result of this Qubole Command
    is evaluated using python ``bool`` casting. If any of the
    values return ``False``, the check is failed and errors out.

    Note that Python bool casting evals the following as ``False``:

    * ``False``
    * ``0``
    * Empty string (``""``)
    * Empty list (``[]``)
    * Empty dictionary or set (``{}``)

    Given a query like ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo``, it will fail only if
    the count ``== 0``. You can craft much more complex query that could,
    for instance, check that the table has the same number of rows as
    the source table upstream, or that the count of today's partition is
    greater than yesterday's partition, or that a set of metrics are less
    than 3 standard deviation for the 7 day average.

    This operator can be used as a data quality check in your pipeline, and
    depending on where you put it in your DAG, you have the choice to
    stop the critical path, preventing from
    publishing dubious data, or on the side and receive email alerts
    without stopping the progress of the DAG.

        performing checks. This callable should return a list of records on which the checks have to be
        performed.
