SQLExecuteQueryOperator to connect to Oracle
============================================

Use the :class:`SQLExecuteQueryOperator<airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql>` to execute
Oracle commands in a `Oracle <https://docs.oracle.com/en/>`__ database.

.. note::
    Previously, ``OracleStoredProcedureOperator`` was used to perform this kind of operation. After deprecation this has been removed. Please use ``SQLExecuteQueryOperator`` instead.

Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``conn_id`` argument to connect to your Oracle instance where
the connection metadata is structured as follows:

.. list-table:: Oracle Airflow Connection Metadata
   :widths: 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Input
   * - Host: string
     - Oracle database hostname
   * - Schema: string
     - Schema to execute SQL operations on by default
   * - Login: string
     - Oracle database user
   * - Password: string
     - Oracle database user password
   * - Port: int
     - Oracle database port (default: 1521)
   * - Extra: JSON
     - Additional connection configuration, such as DSN string:
       ``{"dsn": "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=<hostname>)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=<service_name>)))"}``

An example usage of the SQLExecuteQueryOperator to connect to Oracle is as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../providers/oracle/tests/system/oracle/example_oracle.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_oracle]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_oracle]


Reference
^^^^^^^^^
For further information, look at:

* `Oracle Documentation <https://docs.oracle.com/en/>`__

.. note::

  Parameters given via SQLExecuteQueryOperator() are given first-place priority
  relative to parameters set via Airflow connection metadata (such as ``schema``, ``login``, ``password`` etc).
