package-name: apache-airflow-providers-edge3
name: Edge Executor
description: |
  Handle edge workers on remote sites via HTTP(s) connection and orchestrates work over distributed sites.

  When tasks need to be executed on remote sites where the connection need to pass through
  firewalls or other network restrictions, the Edge Worker can be deployed. The Edge Worker
  is a lightweight process with reduced dependencies. The worker only needs to be able to
  communicate with the central Airflow site via HTTPS.

  In the central Airflow site the EdgeExecutor is used to orchestrate the work. The EdgeExecutor
  is a custom executor which is used to schedule tasks on the edge workers. The EdgeExecutor can co-exist
  with other executors (for example CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor) in the same Airflow site.

  Additional REST API endpoints are provided to distribute tasks and manage the edge workers. The endpoints
  are provided by the API server.

# Note that those versions are maintained by release manager - do not update them manually

# In such case adding >= NEW_VERSION and bumping to NEW_VERSION in a provider have
# to be done in the same PR

        description: |
          Flag if the plugin endpoint is enabled to serve Edge Workers.
        version_added: ~
        type: boolean
        example: "True"
        default: "False"
      api_url:
        description: |
          URL endpoint on which the Airflow code edge API is accessible from edge worker.
        version_added: ~
        type: string
        example: https://airflow.hosting.org/edge_worker/v1/rpcapi
        default: ~
      job_poll_interval:
        description: |
          Edge Worker currently polls for new jobs via HTTP. This parameter defines the number
          of seconds it should sleep between polls for new jobs.
          Job polling only happens if the Edge Worker seeks for new work. Not if busy.
        version_added: ~
        type: integer
        example: "5"
        default: "5"
      heartbeat_interval:
        description: |
          Edge Worker continuously reports status to the central site. This parameter defines
          how often a status with heartbeat should be sent.
          During heartbeat status is reported as well as it is checked if a running task is to be terminated.
        version_added: ~
        type: integer
        example: "10"
        default: "30"
      worker_concurrency:
        description: |
          The concurrency defines the default max parallel running task instances and can also be set during
          start of worker with the ``airflow edge worker`` command parameter. The size of the workers
          and the resources must support the nature of your tasks. The parameter
          works together with the concurrency_slots parameter of a task.
        version_added: ~
        type: integer
        example: ~
        default: "8"
      job_success_purge:
        description: |
          Minutes after which successful jobs for EdgeExecutor are purged from database
        version_added: ~
        type: integer
        example: ~
        default: "5"
      job_fail_purge:
        description: |
          Minutes after which failed jobs for EdgeExecutor are purged from database

        example: ~
        default: "60"
      push_log_chunk_size:
        description: |
          Edge Worker uploads log files in chunks. If the log file part which is uploaded
          exceeds the chunk size it creates a new request. The application gateway can
          limit the max body size see:
          https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size
          A HTTP 413 issue can point to this value to fix the issue.
          This value must be defined in Bytes.
        version_added: ~
        type: integer
        example: ~
        default: "524288"
      push_logs:
        description: |
          Flag to enable or disable pushing of log files from edge worker to the central site.
          When enabled, edge workers will upload task log files in chunks to the central Airflow site.
          When disabled, logs will only be available locally on the edge worker.
        version_added: 1.5.0

        default: "True"

          This controls the file-creation mode mask which determines the initial value of file permission bits
          for newly created files.

          This value is treated as an octal-integer.
