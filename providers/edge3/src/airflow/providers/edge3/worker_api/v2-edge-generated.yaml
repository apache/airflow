  description: 'This is Airflow Edge Worker API - this is a the access endpoint for
    workers running on remote sites serving for Apache Airflow jobs. It also serves
    for the Edge Worker UI and provides endpoints for React web app.

    All endpoints under ``/edge_worker/v1`` are used by remote workers and need a
    specific JWT token.

    All endpoints under ``/edge_worker/ui`` are used by UI and can be accessed with
    normal authentication. Please assume UI endpoints to change and not be stable.'

      description: To authenticate Airflow API requests, clients must include a JWT
        (JSON Web Token) in the Authorization header of each request. This token is
        used to verify the identity of the client and ensure that they have the appropriate
        permissions to access the requested resources. You can use the endpoint ``POST
        /auth/token`` in order to generate a JWT token. Upon successful authentication,
        the server will issue a JWT token that contains the necessary information
        (such as user identity and scope) to authenticate subsequent requests. To
        learn more about Airflow public API authentication, please read https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/api.html.
