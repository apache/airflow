Edge UI Plugin and REST API
===========================

The Edge provider uses a Plugin to

- Extend the REST API endpoints for connecting workers to the Airflow cluster
- Provide a web UI for managing the workers and monitoring their status and tasks
  (Note: Airflow 3.0 does not have support for UI plugins. The UI plugin is only available in Airflow 2.10 and in 3.1 and newer.)

REST API endpoints
------------------

The Edge provider adds the following REST API endpoints to the Airflow API:

- ``/edge_worker/v1/jobs``: Endpoints to fetch jobs for workers and report state
- ``/edge_worker/v1/logs``: Endpoint to push log chunks from workers to the Airflow cluster
- ``/edge_worker/v1/workers``: Endpoints to register and manage workers, report heartbeat
- ``/edge_worker/v1/health``: Check that the API endpoint is deployed and active

To see full documentation of the API endpoints open the Airflow web UI and navigate to
the sub-path ``/edge_worker/docs`` (Airflow 3.0) or ``/edge_worker/v1/ui`` (Airflow 2.10).

Web UI Plugin
-------------

.. note::

    Airflow 3.0 does not support UI plugins. The UI plugin is only available in Airflow 2.10 and in 3.1 and newer.
    Alternatively you can use the CLI commands as described in :ref:`deployment:maintenance-mgmt-cli`.

The Edge provider adds a web UI plugin to the Airflow web UI. The plugin is
made to be able to see job queue and Edge Worker status.

Pending and processes tasks can be checked in "Admin" - "Edge Worker Jobs" page.

Worker status can be checked via the web UI in the "Admin" - "Edge Worker" page.

Via the UI you can also set the status of the worker to "Maintenance" or "Active".

The status and maintenance comments will also be shown in the web UI
in the "Admin" - "Edge Worker" page.

Note that maintenance mode can also be adjusted via CLI.
See :ref:`deployment:maintenance` for more details.
