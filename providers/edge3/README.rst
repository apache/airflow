Package ``apache-airflow-providers-edge3``

Release: ``2.0.0``


Handle edge workers on remote sites via HTTP(s) connection and orchestrates work over distributed sites.

When tasks need to be executed on remote sites where the connection need to pass through
firewalls or other network restrictions, the Edge Worker can be deployed. The Edge Worker
is a lightweight process with reduced dependencies. The worker only needs to be able to
communicate with the central Airflow site via HTTPS.

In the central Airflow site the EdgeExecutor is used to orchestrate the work. The EdgeExecutor
is a custom executor which is used to schedule tasks on the edge workers. The EdgeExecutor can co-exist
with other executors (for example CeleryExecutor or KubernetesExecutor) in the same Airflow site.

Additional REST API endpoints are provided to distribute tasks and manage the edge workers. The endpoints
are provided by the API server.
