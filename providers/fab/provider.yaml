      session_backend:
        description: |
          The type of backend used to store web session data, can be ``database`` or ``securecookie``. For the
          ``database`` backend, sessions are store in the database and they can be
          managed there (for example when you reset password of the user, all sessions for that user are
          deleted). For the ``securecookie`` backend, sessions are stored in encrypted cookies on the client
          side. The ``securecookie`` mechanism is 'lighter' than database backend, but sessions are not
          deleted when you reset password of the user, which means that other than waiting for expiry time,
          the only way to invalidate all sessions for a user is to change secret_key and restart webserver
          (which also invalidates and logs out all other user's sessions).

          When you are using ``database`` backend, make sure to keep your database session table small
          by periodically running ``airflow db clean --table session`` command, especially if you have
          automated API calls that will create a new session for each call rather than reuse the sessions
          stored in browser cookies.
        version_added: 2.0.0
        type: string
        example: "securecookie"
        default: "database"
      session_lifetime_minutes:
        description: |
          The UI cookie lifetime in minutes. User will be logged out from UI after
          ``[fab] session_lifetime_minutes`` of non-activity
        version_added: 2.0.0
        type: integer
        example: ~
        default: "43200"
