    """
    Submit and execute Job on Ray cluster.

    When a job is submitted, it runs once to completion or failure. Retries or
    different runs with different parameters should be handled by the
    submitter. Jobs are bound to the lifetime of a Ray cluster, so if the
    cluster goes down, all running jobs on that cluster will be terminated.

    :param cluster_address: Required. Either (1) the address of the Ray cluster, or (2) the HTTP address
        of the dashboard server on the head node, e.g. "http://<head-node-ip>:8265".
        In case (1) it must be specified as an address that can be passed to
        ray.init(), e.g. a Ray Client address (ray://<head_node_host>:10001),
        or "auto", or "localhost:<port>".
    :param entrypoint: Required. The shell command to run for this job.
    :param get_job_logs: If set to True, the operator will wait until the end of
        Job execution and output the logs.
    :param wait_for_job_done: If set to True, the operator will wait until the end of
        Job execution. Please note, that if the Job will fail during execution and
        this parameter is set to False, there will be no indication of the failure.
    :param submission_id: A unique ID for this job.
    :param runtime_env: The runtime environment to install and run this job in.
    :param metadata: Arbitrary data to store along with this job.
    :param entrypoint_num_cpus: The quantity of CPU cores to reserve for the execution
        of the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors launched
        by it. Defaults to 0.
    :param entrypoint_num_gpus: The quantity of GPUs to reserve for the execution
        of the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors launched
        by it. Defaults to 0.
    :param entrypoint_memory: The quantity of memory to reserve for the
        execution of the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or
        actors launched by it. Defaults to 0.
    :param entrypoint_resources: The quantity of custom resources to reserve for the
        execution of the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or
        actors launched by it.
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.

        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
