Google Cloud AI Platform Operators
==================================

`Google Cloud AI Platform <https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/>`__ (formerly known
as ML Engine) can be used to train machine learning models at scale, host trained models
in the cloud, and use models to make predictions for new data. AI Platform is a collection
of tools for training, evaluating, and tuning machine learning models. AI Platform can also
be used to deploy a trained model, make predictions, and manage various model versions.

The legacy versions of AI Platform Training, AI Platform Prediction, AI Platform Pipelines,
and AI Platform Data Labeling Service are deprecated and will no longer be available on
Google Cloud after their shutdown date. All the functionality of legacy AI Platform and new
features are available on the Vertex AI platform.
