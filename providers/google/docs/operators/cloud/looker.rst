Google Cloud Looker Operators
===============================

Looker is a business intelligence software and big data analytics platform that
helps you explore, analyze and share real-time business analytics easily.

Looker has a Public API and associated SDK clients in different languages,
which allow programmatic access to the Looker data platform.

For more information visit `Looker API documentation <https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration>`_.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

To use these operators, you must do a few things:

* Install API libraries via **pip**.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install 'apache-airflow[google]'

Detailed information is available for :doc:`Installation <apache-airflow:installation/index>`.

* Setup a Looker connection in Airflow. You can check :doc:`apache-airflow:howto/connection` and :doc:`/connections/gcp_looker`

Start a PDT materialization job
-------------------------------

To submit a PDT materialization job to Looker you need to provide a model and view name.

The job configuration can be submitted in synchronous (blocking) mode by using:
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.looker.LookerStartPdtBuildOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_looker.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START how_to_cloud_looker_start_pdt_build_operator]
    :end-before: [END how_to_cloud_looker_start_pdt_build_operator]


Alternatively, the job configuration can be submitted in asynchronous mode by using:
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.looker.LookerStartPdtBuildOperator` and
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.sensors.looker.LookerCheckPdtBuildSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_looker.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START cloud_looker_async_start_pdt_sensor]
    :end-before: [END cloud_looker_async_start_pdt_sensor]

There are more arguments to provide in the jobs than the examples show.
For the complete list of arguments take a look at Looker operator arguments at :class:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.looker.LookerStartPdtBuildOperator`
