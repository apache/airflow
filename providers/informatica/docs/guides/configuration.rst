Configuration
=============

This section describes how to configure the Informatica provider for Apache Airflow.

Connection Setup
----------------

Create an HTTP connection in Airflow for Informatica EDC:

1. **Connection Type**: ``http``
2. **Host**: Your EDC server hostname
3. **Port**: EDC server port (typically 9087)
4. **Schema**: ``https`` or ``http``
5. **Login**: EDC username
6. **Password**: EDC password
7. **Extras**: Add the following JSON:

   .. code-block:: json

       {"security_domain": "your_security_domain"}

Configuration Options
---------------------

Add to your ``airflow.cfg``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [informatica]
    # Disable sending events without uninstalling the Informatica Provider
    disabled = False
    # The connection ID to use when no connection ID is provided
    default_conn_id = informatica_edc_default

Provider Configuration
----------------------

The provider configuration is defined in ``get_provider_info.py`` and includes:

- ``disabled``: Boolean flag to disable the provider without uninstalling
- ``default_conn_id``: Default connection ID for Informatica EDC

SSL and Security
----------------

The connection supports SSL verification control through extras:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "security_domain": "your_domain",
        "verify_ssl": true
    }

Set ``verify_ssl`` to ``false`` to disable SSL certificate verification.
