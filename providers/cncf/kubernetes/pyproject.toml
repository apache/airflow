    # The Kubernetes API is known to introduce problems when upgraded to a MAJOR version. Airflow Core
    # Uses Kubernetes for Kubernetes executor, and we also know that Kubernetes Python client follows SemVer
    # (https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility). This is a crucial component of Airflow
    # So we should limit it to the next MAJOR version and only deliberately bump the version when we
    # tested it, and we know it can be bumped. Bumping this version should also be connected with
    # limiting minimum airflow version supported in cncf.kubernetes provider, due to the
    # potential breaking changes in Airflow Core as well (kubernetes is added as extra, so Airflow
    # core is not hard-limited via install-requirements, only by extra).

    # (started from current 24.2.2 version) to prevent introducing some problems that could be due to some
    #  major changes in the package.
