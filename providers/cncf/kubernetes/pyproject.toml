    # tested it, and we know it can be bumped. Bumping this version should also be connected with
    # limiting minimum airflow version supported in cncf.kubernetes provider, due to the
    # potential breaking changes in Airflow Core as well (kubernetes is added as extra, so Airflow
    # core is not hard-limited via install-requirements, only by extra).
