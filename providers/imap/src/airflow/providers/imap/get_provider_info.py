You can switch it to "none" if you want to disable checking\nof the certificates, but it is not recommended as it allows MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks\nif your infrastructure is not sufficiently secured. It should only be set temporarily while you\nare fixing your certificate configuration. This can be typically done by upgrading to newer\nversion of the operating system you run Airflow components on,by upgrading/refreshing proper\ncertificates in the OS or by updating certificates for your mail servers.\nIf you do not set this option explicitly, it will use Airflow "email.ssl_context" configuration,\nbut if this configuration is not present, it will use "default" value.\n',
