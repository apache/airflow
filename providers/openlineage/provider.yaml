name: OpenLineage Airflow
description: |
  `OpenLineage <https://openlineage.io/docs/>`__ is an open framework for data lineage collection.
  At its core it is an extensible specification that systems can use to interoperate with lineage metadata.

# Note that those versions are maintained by release manager - do not update them manually
# with the exception of case where other provider in sources has >= new provider version.
# In such case adding >= NEW_VERSION and bumping to NEW_VERSION in a provider have
# to be done in the same PR

config:
  openlineage:
    description: |
      This section applies settings for OpenLineage integration.

    options:
      config_path:
        description: |
          Specify the path to the YAML configuration file.
          This ensures backwards compatibility with passing config through the `openlineage.yml` file.
        version_added: ~
        type: string
        example: "full/path/to/openlineage.yml"
        default: ""
      custom_run_facets:
        description: |
          Register custom run facet functions by passing a string of semicolon separated full import paths.
        type: string
        example: full.path.to.custom_facet_function;full.path.to.another_custom_facet_function
        default: ''
        version_added: 1.10.0
      dag_state_change_process_pool_size:
        description: |
          Number of processes to utilize for processing DAG state changes
          in an asynchronous manner within the scheduler process.
        default: "1"
        example: ~
        type: integer
        version_added: 1.8.0
      debug_mode:
        description: |
          If true, OpenLineage events will include information useful for debugging - potentially
          containing large fields e.g. all installed packages and their versions.
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        type: boolean
        version_added: 1.11.0
      disable_source_code:
        description: |
          Disable the inclusion of source code in OpenLineage events by setting this to `true`.
          By default, several Operators (e.g. Python, Bash) will include their source code in the events
          unless disabled.
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        type: boolean
        version_added: ~
      disabled:
        description: |
          Disable sending events without uninstalling the OpenLineage Provider by setting this to true.
        type: boolean
        example: ~
        default: "False"
        version_added: ~
      disabled_for_operators:
        description: |
          Exclude some Operators from emitting OpenLineage events by passing a string of semicolon separated
          full import paths of Operators to disable.
        type: string
        example: "airflow.providers.standard.operators.bash.BashOperator;
          airflow.providers.standard.operators.python.PythonOperator"
        default: ""
        version_added: 1.1.0
      execution_timeout:
        description: |
          Maximum amount of time (in seconds) that OpenLineage can spend executing metadata extraction for
          task (on worker). Note that other configurations, sometimes with higher priority, such as
          `[core] task_success_overtime
          <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#task-success-overtime>`_,
          may also affect how much time OpenLineage has for execution.
        default: "10"
        example: ~
        type: integer
        version_added: 1.9.0
      extractors:
        description: |
          Register custom OpenLineage Extractors by passing a string of semicolon separated full import paths.
        type: string
        example: full.path.to.ExtractorClass;full.path.to.AnotherExtractorClass
        default: ~
        version_added: ~
      include_full_task_info:
        description: |
          If true, OpenLineage task events include full serialized task (operator) information.
          By default, the AirflowRunFacet attached to task events contains only a selected subset
          of task parameters. With this flag on, all serializable task parameters are sent
          (excluding known non-serializable elements), which may significantly increase event size.

          Warning: By setting this variable to true, OpenLineage event can potentially include elements that
          are megabytes in size or larger, depending on the size of data you pass to the task.
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        type: boolean
        version_added: 1.10.0
      namespace:
        description: |
          Set namespace that the lineage data belongs to, so that if you use multiple OpenLineage producers,
          events coming from them will be logically separated.
        version_added: ~
        type: string
        example: "my_airflow_instance_1"
        default: ~
      selective_enable:
        description: |
          If this setting is enabled, OpenLineage integration won't collect and emit metadata,
          unless you explicitly enable it per `DAG` or `Task` using  `enable_lineage` method.
        type: boolean
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        version_added: 1.7.0
      spark_inject_parent_job_info:
        description: |
          Automatically inject OpenLineage's parent job (namespace, job name, run id) information into Spark
          application properties for supported Operators.
        type: boolean
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        version_added: 2.0.0
      spark_inject_transport_info:
        description: |
          Automatically inject OpenLineage's transport information into Spark application properties
          for supported Operators.
        type: boolean
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        version_added: 2.1.0
      transport:
        description: |
          Pass OpenLineage Client transport configuration as a JSON string, including the transport type
          and any additional options specific to that type, as described in `OpenLineage docs
          <https://openlineage.io/docs/client/python/configuration#transports>`_.
        type: string
        example: '{"type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:5000", "endpoint": "api/v1/lineage"}'
        default: ""
        version_added: ~
