    # containing a DAG is required.
    # Here's a quick start guide to create an MWAA environment using AWS CloudFormation:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/quick-start.html
    # If creating the environment using the AWS console, make sure to have a VPC with
    # at least 1 private subnet to be able to select the VPC while going through the
    # environment creation steps in the console wizard.
    # Make sure to set the environment variables with appropriate values
