AWS Batch
=========

`AWS Batch <https://aws.amazon.com/batch/>`__ enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.
Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute
resources. AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required
infrastructure.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: _partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:BatchOperator:

Submit a new AWS Batch job
==========================

To submit a new AWS Batch job and monitor it until it reaches a terminal state you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.batch.BatchOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch]

.. _howto/operator:BatchCreateComputeEnvironmentOperator:

Create an AWS Batch compute environment
=======================================

To create a new AWS Batch compute environment you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.batch.BatchCreateComputeEnvironmentOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_create_compute_environment]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_create_compute_environment]

Sensors
-------

.. _howto/sensor:BatchSensor:

Wait on an AWS Batch job state
==============================

To wait on the state of an AWS Batch Job until it reaches a terminal state you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.batch.BatchSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_batch]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_batch]

.. _howto/sensor:BatchComputeEnvironmentSensor:

Wait on an AWS Batch compute environment status
===============================================

To wait on the status of an AWS Batch compute environment until it reaches a terminal status you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.batch.BatchComputeEnvironmentSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_batch_compute_environment]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_batch_compute_environment]

.. _howto/sensor:BatchJobQueueSensor:

Wait on an AWS Batch job queue status
=====================================

To wait on the status of an AWS Batch job queue until it reaches a terminal status you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.batch.BatchJobQueueSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_batch_job_queue]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_batch_job_queue]
