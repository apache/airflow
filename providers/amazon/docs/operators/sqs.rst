==========
Amazon SQS
==========

`Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) <https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/>`__  is a fully managed message queuing
service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless
applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
message-oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you
can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages
or requiring other services to be available.
