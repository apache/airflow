Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio
===============================

`Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio>`__ is a unified development experience that
brings together AWS data, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) services.
It provides a place to build, deploy, execute, and monitor end-to-end workflows from a single interface.
This helps drive collaboration across teams and facilitate agile development.

Airflow provides operators to orchestrate Notebooks, Querybooks, and Visual ETL jobs within SageMaker Unified Studio Workflows.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

To use these operators, you must do a few things:

  * Create a SageMaker Unified Studio domain.
  * Within your domain, create a project with the "Data analytics and AI-ML model development" project profile.
  * Within your project:
    * Navigate to the "Compute > Workflow environments" tab, and click "Create" to create a new MWAA environment.
    * Create a Notebook, Querybook, or Visual ETL job and save it to your project.
