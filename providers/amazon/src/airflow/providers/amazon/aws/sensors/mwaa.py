    Waits for a DAG Run in an MWAA Environment to complete.

    If the DAG Run fails, an AirflowException is thrown.

        For more information on how to use this sensor, take a look at the guide:

        (templated)
    :param external_dag_id: The DAG ID in the external MWAA environment that contains the DAG Run you want to wait for
        (templated)
    :param external_dag_run_id: The DAG Run ID in the external MWAA environment that you want to wait for (templated)
    :param success_states: Collection of DAG Run states that would make this task marked as successful, default is
        ``{airflow.utils.state.DagRunState.SUCCESS}`` (templated)
    :param failure_states: Collection of DAG Run states that would make this task marked as failed and raise an
        AirflowException, default is ``{airflow.utils.state.DagRunState.FAILED}`` (templated)
    :param deferrable: If True, the sensor will operate in deferrable mode. This mode requires aiobotocore
        module to be installed.
        (default: False, but can be overridden in config file by setting default_deferrable to True)
    :param poke_interval: Polling period in seconds to check for the status of the job. (default: 60)
    :param max_retries: Number of times before returning the current state. (default: 720)
    :param aws_conn_id: The Airflow connection used for AWS credentials.
        If this is ``None`` or empty then the default boto3 behaviour is used. If
        running Airflow in a distributed manner and aws_conn_id is None or
        empty, then default boto3 configuration would be used (and must be
        maintained on each worker node).
    :param region_name: AWS region_name. If not specified then the default boto3 behaviour is used.
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates. See:
        https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html
    :param botocore_config: Configuration dictionary (key-values) for botocore client. See:
        https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html
