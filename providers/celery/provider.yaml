          a worker will take, so size up your workers based on the resources on

      worker_prefetch_multiplier:
        description: |
          Used to increase the number of tasks that a worker prefetches which can improve performance.
          The number of processes multiplied by worker_prefetch_multiplier is the number of tasks
          that are prefetched by a worker. A value greater than 1 can result in tasks being unnecessarily
          blocked if there are multiple workers and one worker prefetches tasks that sit behind long
          running tasks while another worker has unutilized processes that are unable to process the already
          claimed blocked tasks.

      worker_enable_remote_control:
        description: |
          Specify if remote control of the workers is enabled.
          In some cases when the broker does not support remote control, Celery creates lots of
          ``.*reply-celery-pidbox`` queues. You can prevent this by setting this to false.
          However, with this disabled Flower won't work.

          or insert it into a database (depending of the backend)
          This status is used by the scheduler to update the state of the task

      task_acks_late:
        description: |
          If an Airflow task's execution time exceeds the visibility_timeout, Celery will re-assign the
          task to a Celery worker, even if the original task is still running successfully. The new task
          instance then runs concurrently with the original task and the Airflow UI and logs only show an
          error message:
          'Task Instance Not Running' FAILED: Task is in the running state'
          Setting task_acks_late to True will force Celery to wait until a task is finished before a
          new task instance is assigned. This effectively overrides the visibility timeout.
          See also:

          Celery task will report its status as 'started' when the task is executed by a worker.
          This is used in Airflow to keep track of the running tasks and if a Scheduler is restarted
          or run in HA mode, it can adopt the orphan tasks launched by previous SchedulerJob.

      task_publish_max_retries:

      visibility_timeout:
        description: |
          The visibility timeout defines the number of seconds to wait for the worker
          to acknowledge the task before the message is redelivered to another worker.
          Make sure to increase the visibility timeout to match the time of the longest
          ETA you're planning to use.
          visibility_timeout is only supported for Redis and SQS celery brokers.

      sentinel_kwargs:

          In a typical scenario where Redis Sentinel is used as the broker and Redis servers are
          password-protected, the password needs to be passed through this parameter. Although its
          type is string, it is required to pass a string that conforms to the dictionary format.
