Microsoft Azure Connection
==========================

The Microsoft Azure connection type enables the Azure Integrations.

Authenticating to Azure
-----------------------

There are five ways to connect to Azure using Airflow.

1. Use `token credentials`_
   i.e. add specific credentials (client_id, secret, tenant) and subscription id to the Airflow connection.
2. Use a `JSON file`_
3. Use a `JSON dictionary`_
   i.e. add a key config directly into the Airflow connection.
4. Use managed identity by setting ``managed_identity_client_id``, ``workload_identity_tenant_id`` (under the hook, it uses DefaultAzureCredential_ with these arguments)
5. Fallback on `DefaultAzureCredential`_
   This includes a mechanism to try different options to authenticate: Managed System Identity, environment variables, authentication through Azure CLI and etc. ``subscriptionId`` is required in this authentication mechanism.

Only one authorization method can be used at a time. If you need to manage multiple credentials or keys then you should
configure multiple connections.

Default Connection IDs
----------------------

All hooks and operators related to Microsoft Azure Container Instances use ``azure_default`` by default.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------

Login (optional)
    Specify the ``client_id`` used for the initial connection.
    This is only needed for *token credentials* authentication mechanism.
    It can be left out to fall back on DefaultAzureCredential_.

Password (optional)
    Specify the ``secret`` used for the initial connection.
    This is only needed for *token credentials* authentication mechanism.
    It can be left out to fall back on DefaultAzureCredential_.

Extra (optional)
    Specify the extra parameters (as json dictionary) that can be used in Azure connection.
    The following parameters are all optional:

    * ``tenantId``: Specify the tenant to use.
      This is only needed for *token credentials* authentication mechanism.
    * ``subscriptionId``: Specify the subscription id to use.
      This is only needed for *token credentials* and DefaultAzureCredential_ authentication mechanism.
    * ``key_path``: If set, it uses the *JSON file* authentication mechanism.
      It specifies the path to the json file that contains the authentication information.
    * ``key_json``: If set, it uses the *JSON dictionary* authentication mechanism.
      It specifies the json that contains the authentication information.
    * ``managed_identity_client_id``:  The client ID of a user-assigned managed identity. If provided with ``workload_identity_tenant_id``, they'll pass to DefaultAzureCredential_.
    * ``workload_identity_tenant_id``: ID of the application's Microsoft Entra tenant. Also called its "directory" ID. If provided with ``managed_identity_client_id``, they'll pass to DefaultAzureCredential_.

    The entire extra column can be left out to fall back on DefaultAzureCredential_.

When specifying the connection in environment variable you should specify
it using URI syntax.

Note that all components of the URI should be URL-encoded.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AIRFLOW_CONN_AZURE_DEFAULT='azure://?key_path=%2Fkeys%2Fkey.json'
