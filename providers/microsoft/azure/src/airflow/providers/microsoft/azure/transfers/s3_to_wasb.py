    Operator to move data from and AWS S3 Bucket to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.

    A similar class exists to move data from Microsoft Azure Blob Storage to an AWS S3 Bucket, and lives in
    the airflow/providers/amazon/aws/transfers/azure_blob_to_s3.py file

    Either an explicit S3 key can be provided, or a prefix containing the files that are to be transferred to
    Azure blob storage. The same holds for a Blob name; an explicit name can be passed, or a Blob prefix can
    be provided for the file to be stored to

    .. seealso:
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator::SFTPToWasbOperator`

    :param aws_conn_id: ID for the AWS S3 connection to use.
    :param wasb_conn_id: ID for the Azure Blob Storage connection to use.
    :param s3_bucket: The name of the AWS S3 bucket that an object (or objects)  would be transferred from.
        (templated)
    :param container_name: The name of the Azure Storage Blob container an object (or objects) would be
        transferred to. (templated)
    :param s3_prefix: Prefix string that filters any S3 objects that begin with this prefix. (templated)
    :param s3_key: An explicit S3 key (object) to be transferred. (templated)
    :param blob_prefix: Prefix string that would provide a path in the Azure Storage Blob container for an
        object (or objects) to be moved to. (templated)
    :param blob_name: An explicit blob name that an object would be transferred to. This can only be used
        if a single file is being moved. If there are multiple files in an S3 bucket that are to be moved
        to a single Azure blob, an exception will be raised. (templated)
    :param create_container: True if a container should be created if it did not already exist, False
        otherwise.
    :param replace: If a blob exists in the container and replace takes a value of true, it will be
        overwritten. If replace is False and a blob exists in the container, the file will NOT be
        overwritten.
    :param s3_verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default, SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
