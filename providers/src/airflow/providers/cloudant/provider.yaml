dependencies:

  # Even though 3.9 is excluded below, we need to make this python_version aware so that `uv` can generate a
  # full lock file when building lock file from provider sources
  - 'ibmcloudant==0.9.1 ; python_version >= "3.10"'

excluded-python-versions:
  # ibmcloudant transitively brings in urllib3 2.x, but the snowflake provider has a dependency that pins
  # urllib3 to 1.x on Python 3.9; thus we exclude those Python versions from taking the update
  # to ibmcloudant.
  # See #21004, #41555, and https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/issues/2016
