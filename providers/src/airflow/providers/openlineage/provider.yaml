    options:
      disabled:
        description: |
          Disable sending events without uninstalling the OpenLineage Provider by setting this to true.
        type: boolean
        example: ~
        default: "False"
        version_added: ~
      disabled_for_operators:
        description: |
          Exclude some Operators from emitting OpenLineage events by passing a string of semicolon separated
          full import paths of Operators to disable.
        type: string
        example: "airflow.providers.standard.operators.bash.BashOperator;
          airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator"
        default: ""
        version_added: 1.1.0
      selective_enable:
        description: |
          If this setting is enabled, OpenLineage integration won't collect and emit metadata,
          unless you explicitly enable it per `DAG` or `Task` using  `enable_lineage` method.
        type: boolean
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        version_added: 1.7.0
      namespace:
        description: |
          Set namespace that the lineage data belongs to, so that if you use multiple OpenLineage producers,
          events coming from them will be logically separated.
        version_added: ~
        type: string
        example: "my_airflow_instance_1"
        default: ~
      extractors:
        description: |
          Register custom OpenLineage Extractors by passing a string of semicolon separated full import paths.

        version_added: 1.10.0
      config_path:
        description: |
          Specify the path to the YAML configuration file.
          This ensures backwards compatibility with passing config through the `openlineage.yml` file.

        example: "full/path/to/openlineage.yml"
        default: ""
      transport:
        description: |
          Pass OpenLineage Client transport configuration as JSON string. It should contain type of the
          transport and additional options (different for each transport type). For more details see:

          unless disabled.
        default: "False"
        example: ~
        type: boolean
