HTTP Connection
===============

The HTTP connection enables connections to HTTP services.

Default Connection IDs
----------------------

The HTTP operators and hooks use ``http_default`` by default.

Authentication
--------------

 .. _auth_basic:

Authenticating via Basic auth
.............................
The simplest way to authenticate is to specify a *Login* and *Password* in the
Connection.

.. image:: /img/connection_username_password.png

By default, when a *Login* or *Password* is provided, the HTTP operators and
Hooks will perform a basic authentication via the
``requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth`` class.

Authenticating via Headers
..........................
If :ref:`Basic authentication<auth_basic>` is not enough, you can also add
*Headers* to the requests performed by the HTTP operators and Hooks.

Headers can be passed in json format in the *Headers* field:

.. image:: /img/connection_headers.png

.. note:: Login and Password authentication can be used along custom Headers.

Authenticating via Auth class
.............................
For more complex use-cases, you can inject a Auth class into the HTTP operators
and Hooks via the *Auth type* setting. This is particularly useful when you
need token refresh or advanced authentication methods like kerberos, oauth, ...

.. image:: /img/connection_auth_type.png

By default, only `requests Auth classes <https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/src/requests/auth.py>`_
are available. But you can install any classes based on ``requests.auth.AuthBase``
into your Airflow instance (via pip install), and then specify those classes in
``extra_auth_types`` :doc:`configuration setting<../configurations-ref>` to
make them available in the Connection UI.

If the Auth class requires more than a *Username* and a *Password*, you can
pass extra keywords arguments with the *Auth kwargs* setting.

Example with the ``HTTPKerberosAuth`` from `requests-kerberos <https://pypi.org/project/requests-kerberos>`_ :

.. image:: /img/connection_auth_kwargs.png

.. tip::

    You probably don't need to write an entire custom HttpOperator or HttpHook
    to customize the connection. Simply extend the ``requests.auth.AuthBase``
    class and configure a Connection with it.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------

Via the Admin panel
...................

Configuring the Connection via the Airflow Admin panel offers more
possibilities than via :ref:`environment variables<env-variable>`.

Login (optional)
    The login (username) of the http service you would like to connect too.
    If provided, by default, the HttpHook perform a Basic authentication.

Password (optional)
    The password of the http service you would like to connect too.
    If provided, by default, the HttpHook perform a Basic authentication.

Host (optional)
    Specify the entire url or the base of the url for the service.

Port (optional)
    A port number if applicable.

Schema (optional)
    The service type. E.g: http/https.

Auth type (optional)
    Python class used by the HttpHook (and the underlying requests library) to
    authenticate. If provided, the *Login* and *Password* are passed as the two
    first arguments to this class. If *Login* and/or *Password* are provided
    without any Auth type, the HttpHook will by default perform a basic
    authentication via the ``requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth`` class.

    Extra classes can be added via the ``extra_auth_types``
    :doc:`configuration setting<../configurations-ref>`.

Auth kwargs (optional)
    Extra key-value parameters passed to the Auth type class.

Headers (optional)
    Extra key-value parameters added to the Headers in JSON format.

Extras (optional - deprecated)
    *Deprecated*: Specify headers in json format.

 .. _env-variable:

Via environment variable
........................
Extras (optional)
    Specify headers and default requests parameters in json format.
    Following default requests parameters are taken into account:

    * ``stream``
    * ``cert``
    * ``proxies`` or ``proxy``
    * ``verify`` or ``verify_ssl``
    * ``allow_redirects``
    * ``max_redirects``


When specifying the connection in environment variable you should specify
it using URI syntax.

.. note:: All components of the URI should be **URL-encoded**.

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: Example:

   export AIRFLOW_CONN_HTTP_DEFAULT='http://username:password@service.com:80/https?headers=header'
