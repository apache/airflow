HTTP Operators
==============

The following code examples use the ``http_default`` connection which means the requests are sent against
`httpbin <https://www.httpbin.org/>`__ site to perform basic HTTP operations.

.. _howto/operator:HttpSensor:

HttpSensor
----------

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.http.sensors.http.HttpSensor` to poke until the ``response_check`` callable evaluates
to ``true``.

Here we are poking until httpbin gives us a response text containing ``httpbin``.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_http_sensor_check]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_http_sensor_check]

.. _howto/operator:SimpleHttpOperator:

SimpleHttpOperator
------------------

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.http.operators.http.SimpleHttpOperator` to call HTTP requests and get
the response text back.

.. warning:: Configuring ``https`` via SimpleHttpOperator is counter-intuitive

   For historical reasons, configuring ``HTTPS`` connectivity via HTTP operator is, well, difficult and
   counter-intuitive. The Operator defaults to ``http`` protocol and you can change the schema used by the
   operator via ``scheme`` connection attribute. However this field was originally added to connection for
   database type of URIs, where database schemes are set traditionally as first component of URI ``path``.
   Therefore if you want to configure as ``https`` connection via URI, you need to pass ``https`` scheme
   to the SimpleHttpOperator. AS stupid as it looks, your connection URI will look like this:
   ``http://your_host:443/https``. Then if you want to use different URL paths in SimpleHttpOperator
   you should pass your path as ``endpoint`` parameter when running the task. For example to run a query to
   ``https://your_host:443/my_endpoint`` you need to set the endpoint parameter to ``my_endpoint``.
   Alternatively, if you want, you could also percent-encode the host including the ``https://`` prefix,
   and as long it contains ``://`` (percent-encoded ``%3a%2f%2f``), the first component of the path will
   not be used as scheme. Your URI definition might then look like: ``http://https%3a%2f%2fyour_host:443/``
   In this case however the ``path`` will not be used at all - you still need to use ``endpoint``
   parameter in the task if wish to make a request with specific path. As counter-intuitive as it is, this
   is historically the way how the operator/hook works and it's not easy to change without breaking
   backwards compatibility because there are other operators build on top of the ``SimpleHttpOperator`` that
   rely on that functionality and there are many users using it already.


In the first example we are calling a ``POST`` with json data and succeed when we get the same json data back
otherwise the task will fail.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_post_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_post_op]

Here we are calling a ``GET`` request and pass params to it. The task will succeed regardless of the response text.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_get_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_get_op]

SimpleHttpOperator returns the response body as text by default. If you want to modify the response before passing
it on the next task downstream use ``response_filter``. This is useful if:

- the API you are consuming returns a large JSON payload and you're interested in a subset of the data
- the API returns data in xml or csv and you want to convert it to JSON
- you're interested in the headers of the response instead of the body

Below is an example of retrieving data from a REST API and only returning a nested property instead of the full
response body.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_get_op_response_filter]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_get_op_response_filter]

In the third example we are performing a ``PUT`` operation to put / set data according to the data that is being
provided to the request.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_put_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_put_op]

In this example we call a ``DELETE`` operation to the ``delete`` endpoint. This time we are passing form data to the
request.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_del_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_del_op]

Here we pass form data to a ``POST`` operation which is equal to a usual form submit.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/http/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_post_op_formenc]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_post_op_formenc]
