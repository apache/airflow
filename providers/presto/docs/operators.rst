SQLExecuteQueryOperator to connect to Presto
============================================

Use the :class:`SQLExecuteQueryOperator<airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql>` to execute
Presto commands in a `Presto <https://prestodb.io/docs/current/>`__ database.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``conn_id`` argument to connect to your Presto instance where
the connection metadata is structured as follows:

.. list-table:: Presto Airflow Connection Metadata
   :widths: 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Input
   * - Host: string
     - Presto server hostname or container name
   * - Schema: string
     - Schema to execute SQL operations on by default
   * - Login: string
     - Presto user (required)
   * - Password: string
     - Presto user password (if authentication is enabled)
   * - Port: int
     - Presto server port (default: 8080)
   * - Extra: JSON
     - Additional parameters such as `{"user": "airflow_user"}`


An example usage of the SQLExecuteQueryOperator to connect to Presto is as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../providers/presto/tests/system/presto/example_presto.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_presto]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_presto]


Reference
^^^^^^^^^
For further information, look at:

* `Presto Documentation <https://prestodb.io/docs/current/>`__

.. note::

  Parameters given via SQLExecuteQueryOperator() are given first-place priority
  relative to parameters set via Airflow connection metadata (such as ``schema``, ``login``, ``password`` etc).
