    """
    Abstract base hook for integrating Teradata Tools and Utilities (TTU) in Airflow.

    This hook provides common connection handling, resource management, and lifecycle
    support for TTU based operations such as BTEQ, TLOAD, and TPT.

    It should not be used directly. Instead, it must be subclassed by concrete hooks
    like `BteqHook`, `TloadHook`, or `TddlHook` that implement the actual TTU command logic.

    Core Features:
    - Establishes a reusable Teradata connection configuration.
    - Provides context management for safe resource cleanup.
    - Manages subprocess termination (e.g., for long-running TTU jobs).

    Requirements:
    - TTU command-line tools must be installed and accessible via PATH.
    - A valid Airflow connection with Teradata credentials must be configured.
