IO Operators
=============

These operators perform various operations on a filesystem or object storage.

.. _howto/operator:FileTransferOperator:

Transfer a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.common.io.operators.file_transfer.FileTransferOperator` to copy a file from one
location to another. Parameters of the operator are:

- ``src`` - source path as a str or ObjectStoragePath
- ``dst`` - destination path as a str or ObjectStoragePath
- ``src_conn_id`` - source connection id (default: ``None``)
- ``dst_conn_id`` - destination connection id (default: ``None``)
- ``overwrite`` - overwrite destination (default: ``False``)

If the ``src`` and the ``dst`` are both on the same object storage, copy will be performed in the object storage.
Otherwise the data will be streamed from the source to the destination.

The example below shows how to instantiate the SQLExecuteQueryOperator task.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/common/io/example_file_transfer_local_to_s3.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_local_to_s3]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_local_to_s3]
