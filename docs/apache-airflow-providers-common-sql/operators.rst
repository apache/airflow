SQL Operators
=============

These operators perform various queries against a SQL database, including
column- and table-level data quality checks.

.. _howto/operator:SQLColumnCheckOperator:

Check SQL Table Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql.SQLColumnCheckOperator` to run data quality
checks against columns of a given table. As well as a connection ID and table, a column_mapping
describing the relationship between columns and tests to run must be supplied. An example column
mapping is a set of three nested dictionaries and looks like:

.. code-block:: python

        column_mapping = {
            "col_name": {
                "null_check": {
                    "equal_to": 0,
                },
                "min": {
                    "greater_than": 5,
                    "leq_to": 10,
                    "tolerance": 0.2,
                },
                "max": {"less_than": 1000, "geq_to": 10, "tolerance": 0.01},
            }
        }

Where col_name is the name of the column to run checks on, and each entry in its dictionary is a check.
The valid checks are:

- null_check: checks the number of NULL values in the column
- distinct_check: checks the COUNT of values in the column that are distinct
- unique_check: checks the number of distinct values in a column against the number of rows
- min: checks the minimum value in the column
- max: checks the maximum value in the column

Each entry in the check's dictionary is either a condition for success of the check or the tolerance. The
conditions for success are:

- greater_than
- geq_to
- less_than
- leq_to
- equal_to

When specifying conditions, equal_to is not compatible with other conditions. Both a lower- and an upper-
bound condition may be specified in the same check. The tolerance is a percentage that the result may
be out of bounds but still considered successful.



The below example demonstrates how to instantiate the SQLColumnCheckOperator task.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/common/sql/example_sql_column_table_check.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sql_column_check]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sql_column_check]

.. _howto/operator:SQLTableCheckOperator:

Check SQL Table Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.common.sql.operators.sql.SQLTableCheckOperator` to run data quality
checks against a given table. As well as a connection ID and table, a checks dictionary
describing the relationship between the table and tests to run must be supplied. An example
checks argument is a set of two nested dictionaries and looks like:

.. code-block:: python

        checks = (
            {
                "row_count_check": {
                    "check_statement": "COUNT(*) = 1000",
                },
                "column_sum_check": {"check_statement": "col_a + col_b < col_c"},
            },
        )

The first set of keys are the check names, which are referenced in the templated query the operator builds.
The dictionary key under the check name must be check_statement, with the value a SQL statement that
resolves to a boolean (this can be any string or int that resolves to a boolean in
airflow.operators.sql.parse_boolean).

The below example demonstrates how to instantiate the SQLTableCheckOperator task.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/common/sql/example_sql_column_table_check.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sql_table_check]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sql_table_check]
