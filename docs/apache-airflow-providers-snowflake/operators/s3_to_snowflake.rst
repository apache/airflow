S3ToSnowflakeOperator
=====================

Use the :class:`S3ToSnowflakeOperator <airflow.providers.snowflake.transfers.s3_to_snowflake>` to load data stored in `AWS S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__
to a Snowflake table.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to the :class:`SnowflakeOperator <airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake>`, use the ``snowflake_conn_id`` and
the additional relevant parameters to establish connection with your Snowflake instance.
This operator will allow loading of one or more named files from a specific Snowflake stage (predefined S3 path). In order to do so
pass the relevant file names to the ``s3_keys`` parameter and the relevant Snowflake stage to the ``stage`` parameter.
``file_format`` can be used to either reference an already existing Snowflake file format or a custom string that defines
a file format (see `docs <https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format.html>`__).

An example usage of the S3ToSnowflakeOperator is as follows: #TODO: currently forces usage of schema parameter
