Setting Configuration Options
=============================

The first time you run Airflow, it will create a file called ``airflow.cfg`` in
your ``$AIRFLOW_HOME`` directory (``~/airflow`` by default). This file contains Airflow's configuration and you
can edit it to change any of the settings. You can also set options with environment variables by using this format:
:envvar:`AIRFLOW__{SECTION}__{KEY}` (note the double underscores).

For example, the metadata database connection string can either be set in ``airflow.cfg`` like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    sql_alchemy_conn = my_conn_string

or by creating a corresponding environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=my_conn_string

You can also derive the connection string at run time by appending ``_cmd`` to
the key like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    sql_alchemy_conn_cmd = bash_command_to_run

You can also derive the connection string at run time by appending ``_secret`` to
the key like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    sql_alchemy_conn_secret = sql_alchemy_conn
    # You can also add a nested path
    # example:
    # sql_alchemy_conn_secret = database/sql_alchemy_conn

This will retrieve config option from Secret Backends e.g Hashicorp Vault. See
:ref:`Secrets Backends<secrets_backend_configuration>` for more details.

The following config options support this ``_cmd`` and ``_secret`` version:

* ``sql_alchemy_conn`` in ``[database]`` section
* ``fernet_key`` in ``[core]`` section
* ``broker_url`` in ``[celery]`` section
* ``flower_basic_auth`` in ``[celery]`` section
* ``result_backend`` in ``[celery]`` section
* ``password`` in ``[atlas]`` section
* ``smtp_password`` in ``[smtp]`` section
* ``secret_key`` in ``[webserver]`` section

The ``_cmd`` config options can also be set using a corresponding environment variable
the same way the usual config options can. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_CMD=bash_command_to_run

Similarly, ``_secret`` config options can also be set using a corresponding environment variable.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_SECRET=sql_alchemy_conn

.. note::
    The config options must follow the config prefix naming convention defined within the secrets backend. This means that ``sql_alchemy_conn`` is not defined with a connection prefix, but with config prefix. For example it should be named as ``airflow/config/sql_alchemy_conn``

The idea behind this is to not store passwords on boxes in plain text files.

The universal order of precedence for all configuration options is as follows:

#. set as an environment variable (``AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN``)
#. set as a command environment variable (``AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_CMD``)
#. set as a secret environment variable (``AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_SECRET``)
#. set in ``airflow.cfg``
#. command in ``airflow.cfg``
#. secret key in ``airflow.cfg``
#. Airflow's built in defaults

.. note::
    For Airflow versions >= 2.2.1, < 2.3.0 Airflow's built in defaults took precedence
    over command and secret key in ``airflow.cfg`` in some circumstances.

You can check the current configuration with the ``airflow config list`` command.

If you only want to see the value for one option, you can use ``airflow config get-value`` command as in
the example below.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ airflow config get-value core executor
    SequentialExecutor

.. note::
    For more information on configuration options, see :doc:`../configurations-ref`

.. note::
    See :doc:`../modules_management` for details on how Python and Airflow manage modules.

.. note::
    Use the same configuration across all the Airflow components. While each component
    does not require all, some configurations need to be same otherwise they would not
    work as expected. A good example for that is :ref:`secret_key<config:webserver__secret_key>` which
    should be same on the Webserver and Worker to allow Webserver to fetch logs from Worker.

    The webserver key is also used to authorize requests to Celery workers when logs are retrieved. The token
    generated using the secret key has a short expiry time though - make sure that time on ALL the machines
    that you run airflow components on is synchronized (for example using ntpd) otherwise you might get
    "forbidden" errors when the logs are accessed.
