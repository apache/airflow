Add tags to DAGs and use it for filtering in the UI
===================================================

.. versionadded:: 1.10.8

In order to filter DAGs (e.g by team), you can add tags in each dag.
The filter is saved in a cookie and can be reset by the reset button.

For example:

In your Dag file, pass a list of tags you want to add to DAG object:

.. code-block:: python

  dag = DAG(
    dag_id='example_dag_tag',
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',
    tags=['example']
  )
