Add Owner Links to DAG
=======================

.. versionadded:: 2.4.0

You can set the ``owner_links`` argument on your DAG object, which will make the owner a clickable link in the
main DAGs view page instead of a search filter.

Two options are supported:

* An HTTP link (e.g. ``https://www.example.com``) which opens the webpage in your default internet client
* A `mailto <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto>`_ link (e.g. ``mailto:example@airflow.com``) which opens your default email client to send an email to the specified address

In your DAG, set the ``owner_links`` argument specifying a dictionary of an owner (key) and its link (value).
Next define a task using this owner, and the owner in the DAGs view will link to the specified address.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 5

  with DAG(
      dag_id="example_dag_owners",
      start_date=datetime(2022, 8, 5),
      schedule="0 0 * * *",
      owner_links={"airflow": "https://airflow.apache.org"},
  ):
      BashOperator(task_id="task_using_linked_owner", bash_command="echo 1", owner="airflow")
