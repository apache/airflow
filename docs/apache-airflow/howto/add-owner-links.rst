Add Owner Links to DAG
=======================

.. versionadded:: 2.4.0

You can pass the ``owner_link`` parameter for your DAG object, which will make the owner to become a clickable link
in the main DAGs view page.
You can use it to set a custom HTTP link (for example, the owner's Slack channel), or use a
`maitlo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto>`_ link to have an automated email message (up to 500 characters).

Example:
In your DAG file, add a ``owners_link`` parameter to the DAG object that will hold a dictionary of an owner and it's link.
After that, define a task that will use this owner, and the link in the DAGs view will become clickable

.. code-block:: python

  dag = DAG(
      dag_id="example_dag_owners",
      schedule_interval="0 0 * * *",
      start_date=datetime(2022, 8, 5),
      owner_links={"airflow": "https://airflow.apache.org/"},
  )

  with dag:
      bash_task = BashOperator(task_id='task_using_linked_owner', bash_command='echo 1', owner='airflow')
