Params
======

Params are Airflow's concept of providing runtime configuration to tasks when a dag gets triggered manually.
Params are configured while defining the dag & tasks, that can be altered while doing a manual trigger. The
ability to update params while triggering a DAG depends on the flag ``core.dag_run_conf_overrides_params``,
so if that flag is ``False``, params would behave like constants.

To use them, one can use the ``Param`` class for complex trigger-time validations or simply use primitive types,
which won't be doing any such validations.

.. code-block::

    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.models.param import Param

    with DAG(
      'my_dag',
      params: {
        'int_param': Param(10, type='integer', minimum=0, maximum=20),          # a int param with default value
        'str_param': Param(type='string', minLength=2, maxLength=4),            # a mandatory str param
        'dummy_param': Param(type=['null', 'number', 'string'])                 # a param which can be None as well
        'old_param': 'old_way_of_passing',                                      # i.e. no data or type validations
        'simple_param': Param('im_just_like_old_param'),                        # i.e. no data or type validations
        'email_param': Param(
            default='example@example.com',
            type='string',
            format='idn-email',
            minLength=5,
            maxLength=255,
        ),
      }

``Param`` make use of `json-schema <https://json-schema.org/>`__ to define the properties and doing the
validation, so one can use the full json-schema specifications mentioned at
https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html to define the construct of a ``Param``
objects.

Also, it worthwhile to note that if you have any DAG which uses a mandatory param value, i.e. a ``Param``
object with no default value or ``null`` as an allowed type, that DAG schedule has to be ``None``. However,
if such ``Param`` has been defined at task level, Airflow has no way to restrict that & the task would be
failing at the execution time.

.. note::
    As of now, for security reasons, one can not use Param objects derived out of custom classes. We are
    planning to have a registration system for custom Param classes, just like we've for Operator ExtraLinks.
