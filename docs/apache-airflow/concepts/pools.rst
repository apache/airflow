Pools
=====

Some systems can get overwhelmed when too many processes hit them at the same time. Airflow pools can be used to
**limit the execution parallelism** on arbitrary sets of tasks. The list of pools is managed in the UI
(``Menu -> Admin -> Pools``) by giving the pools a name and assigning it a number of worker slots.

Tasks can then be associated with one of the existing pools by using the ``pool`` parameter when creating tasks:

.. code-block:: python

    aggregate_db_message_job = BashOperator(
        task_id="aggregate_db_message_job",
        execution_timeout=timedelta(hours=3),
        pool="ep_data_pipeline_db_msg_agg",
        bash_command=aggregate_db_message_job_cmd,
        dag=dag,
    )
    aggregate_db_message_job.set_upstream(wait_for_empty_queue)


Tasks will be scheduled as usual while the slots fill up. The number of slots occupied by a task can be configured by
``pool_slots``. Once capacity is reached, runnable tasks get queued and their state will show as such in the UI.
As slots free up, queued tasks start running based on the :ref:`concepts:priority-weight` of the task and its
descendants.

Note that if tasks are not given a pool, they are assigned to a default pool ``default_pool``.  ``default_pool`` is
initialized with 128 slots and can be modified through the UI or CLI (but cannot be removed).

.. warning::

    Pools and SubDAGs do not interact as you might first expect. SubDAGs will *not* honor any pool you set on them at
    the top level; pools must be set on the tasks *inside* the SubDAG directly.
