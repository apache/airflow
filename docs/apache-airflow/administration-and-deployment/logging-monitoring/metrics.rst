Metrics Configuration
=====================

Airflow can be set up to send metrics to `StatsD <https://github.com/etsy/statsd>`__
or `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io/>`__.

Setup - StatsD
--------------

To use StatsD you must first install the required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'apache-airflow[statsd]'

then add the following lines to your configuration file e.g. ``airflow.cfg``

.. code-block:: ini

    [metrics]
    statsd_on = True
    statsd_host = localhost
    statsd_port = 8125
    statsd_prefix = airflow

If you want to use a custom StatsD client instead of the default one provided by Airflow,
the following key must be added to the configuration file alongside the module path of your
custom StatsD client. This module must be available on your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.

.. code-block:: ini

    [metrics]
    statsd_custom_client_path = x.y.customclient

See :doc:`../modules_management` for details on how Python and Airflow manage modules.


Setup - OpenTelemetry
---------------------

To use OpenTelemetry you must first install the required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'apache-airflow[otel]'

Add the following lines to your configuration file e.g. ``airflow.cfg``

.. code-block:: ini

    [metrics]
    otel_on = False
    otel_host = localhost
    otel_port = 8889
    otel_prefix = airflow
    otel_interval_milliseconds = 30000  # The interval between exports, defaults to 60000
    otel_ssl_active = False

Enable Https
-----------------

To establish an HTTPS connection to the OpenTelemetry collector
You need to configure the SSL certificate and key within the OpenTelemetry collector's ``config.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         http:
           endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
           tls:
             cert_file: "/path/to/cert/cert.crt"
             key_file: "/path/to/key/key.pem"

Allow/Block Lists
-----------------

If you want to avoid sending all the available metrics, you can configure an allow list or block list
of prefixes to send or block only the metrics that start with the elements of the list:

.. code-block:: ini

    [metrics]
    metrics_allow_list = scheduler,executor,dagrun

.. code-block:: ini

    [metrics]
    metrics_block_list = scheduler,executor,dagrun


Rename Metrics
--------------

If you want to redirect metrics to a different name, you can configure the ``stat_name_handler`` option
in ``[metrics]`` section.  It should point to a function that validates the stat name, applies changes
to the stat name if necessary, and returns the transformed stat name. The function may look as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def my_custom_stat_name_handler(stat_name: str) -> str:
        return stat_name.lower()[:32]


Other Configuration Options
---------------------------

.. note::

    For a detailed listing of configuration options regarding metrics,
    see the configuration reference documentation - :ref:`config:metrics`.
