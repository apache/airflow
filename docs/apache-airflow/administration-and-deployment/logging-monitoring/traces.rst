Traces Configuration
=====================

Airflow can be set up to send traces in `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io>`__.

Setup - OpenTelemetry
---------------------

To use OpenTelemetry you must first install the required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'apache-airflow[otel]'

Add the following lines to your configuration file e.g. ``airflow.cfg``

.. code-block:: ini

    [traces]
    otel_on = False
    otel_host = localhost
    otel_port = 8889
    otel_application = airflow
    otel_ssl_active = False
    otel_task_log_event = True

Enable Https
-----------------

To establish an HTTPS connection to the OpenTelemetry collector
You need to configure the SSL certificate and key within the OpenTelemetry collector's ``config.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         http:
           endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
           tls:
             cert_file: "/path/to/cert/cert.crt"
             key_file: "/path/to/key/key.pem"
