Airflow Security Model
======================

This document describes Airflow's security model from the perspective of
the Airflow user. It is intended to help users understand the security
model and make informed decisions about how to deploy and manage Airflow.

If you would like to know how to report security vulnerabilities and how
security reports are handled by the security team of Airflow, head to
`Airflow's Security Policy <https://github.com/apache/airflow/security/policy>`_.

Airflow security model - user types
-----------------------------------

The Airflow security model involves different types of users with
varying access and capabilities:

1. **Deployment Managers**: They have the highest level of access and
   control. They install and configure Airflow, and make decisions about
   technologies and permissions. They can potentially delete the entire
   installation and have access to all credentials. Deployment Managers
   can also decide to keep audits, backups and copies of information
   outside of Airflow, which are not covered by Airflow's security
   model.

2. **DAG Authors**: They can upload, modify, and delete DAG files. The
   code in DAG files is executed on workers and in the DAG File Processor. Note
   that in the simple deployment configuration, parsing DAGs is executed as
   a subprocess of the Scheduler process, but with Standalone DAG File Processor
   deployment managers might separate parsing DAGs from the Scheduler process.
   Therefore, DAG authors can create and change code executed on workers
   and the DAG File Processor and potentially access the credentials that the DAG
   code uses to access external systems. DAG Authors have full access
   to the metadata database and internal audit logs.

3. **Authenticated UI users**: They have access to the UI and API. See below
   for more details on the capabilities authenticated UI users may have.

4. **Non-authenticated UI users**: Airflow doesn't support
   unauthenticated users by default. If allowed, potential vulnerabilities
   must be assessed and addressed by the Deployment Manager.

Capabilities of authenticated UI users
--------------------------------------

The capabilities of **Authenticated UI users** can vary depending on
what roles have been configured by the Deployment Manager or Admin users
as well as what permissions those roles have. Permissions on roles can be
scoped as tightly as a single DAG, for example, or as broad as Admin.
Below are four general categories to help conceptualize some of the
capabilities authenticated users may have:

1. **Admin users**: They manage and grant permissions to other users,
   with full access to all UI capabilities. They can potentially execute
   code on workers by configuring connections and need to be trusted not
   to abuse these privileges. They have access to sensitive credentials
   and can modify them. By default, they don't have access to
   system-level configuration. They should be trusted not to misuse
   sensitive information accessible through connection configuration.
   They also have the ability to create a Webserver Denial of Service
   situation and should be trusted not to misuse this capability.

2. **Operations users**: The primary difference between an operator and admin
   if the ability to manage and grant permissions to other users - only admins
   are able to do this. Otherwise assume they have the same access as an admin.

3. **Connection configuration users**: They configure connections and
   potentially execute code on workers during DAG execution. Trust is
   required to prevent misuse of these privileges. They have full access
   to sensitive credentials stored in connections and can modify them.
   Access to sensitive information through connection configuration
   should be trusted not to be abused. They also have the ability to
   create a Webserver Denial of Service situation and should be trusted
   not to misuse this capability.

4. **Audit log users**: They can view audit events for the whole Airflow installation.

5. **Normal Users**: They can view and interact with the UI and API.
   They are able to view and edit DAGs, task instances, and DAG runs, and view task logs.

For more information on the capabilities of authenticated UI users, see :doc:`/security/access-control`.

Responsibilities of Deployment Managers
---------------------------------------

Deployment Managers are responsible for deploying airflow and make it accessible to the users
in the way that follows best practices of secure deployment applicable to the organization where
Airflow is deployed. This includes but is not limited to:

* protecting communication using TLS/VPC and whatever network security is required by the organization
  that is deploying Airflow
* applying rate-limiting and other forms of protections that is usually applied to web applications
* applying authentication and authorization to the web application so that only known and authorized
  users can have access to Airflow
* any kind of detection of unusual activity and protection against it
* choosing the right session backend and configuring it properly including timeouts for the session

Airflow does not implement any of those feature natively, and delegates it to the deployment managers
to deploy all the necessary infrastructure to protect the deployment - as external infrastructure components.

Deployment Managers also determine access levels and must understand the potential
damage users can cause. Some Deployment Managers may further limit
access through fine-grained privileges for the **Authenticated UI
users**. However, these limitations are outside the basic Airflow's
security model and are at the discretion of Deployment Managers.
Examples of fine-grained access control include (but are not limited
to):

-  Limiting login permissions: Restricting the accounts that users can
   log in with, allowing only specific accounts or roles belonging to
   access the Airflow system.

-  Access restrictions to views or DAGs: Controlling user access to
   certain views or specific DAGs, ensuring that users can only view or
   interact with authorized components.

-  Implementing static code analysis and code review: Introducing
   processes such as static code analysis and code review as part of the
   DAG submission pipeline. This helps enforce code quality standards,
   security checks, and adherence to best practices before DAGs are
   deployed.

These examples showcase ways in which Deployment Managers can refine and
limit user privileges within Airflow, providing tighter control and
ensuring that users have access only to the necessary components and
functionalities based on their roles and responsibilities. However,
fine-grained access control does not provide full isolation and
separation of access to allow isolation of different user groups in a
multi-tenant fashion yet. In future versions of Airflow, some
fine-grained access control features could become part of the Airflow security
model, as the Airflow community is working on a multi-tenant model currently.
