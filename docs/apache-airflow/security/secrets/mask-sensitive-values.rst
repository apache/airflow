Masking sensitive data
----------------------

Airflow will by default mask Connection passwords and sensitive Variables and keys from a Connection's
extra (JSON) field when they appear in Task logs, in the Variable and in the Rendered fields views of the UI.

It does this by looking for the specific *value* appearing anywhere in your output. This means that if you
have a connection with a password of ``a``, then every instance of the letter a in your logs will be replaced
with ``***``.

To disable masking you can set :ref:`config:core__hide_sensitive_var_conn_fields` to false.

The automatic masking is triggered by Connection or Variable access. This means that if you pass a sensitive
value via XCom or any other side-channel it will not be masked when printed in the downstream task.

Sensitive field names
"""""""""""""""""""""

When masking is enabled, Airflow will always mask the password field of every Connection that is accessed by a
task.

It will also mask the value of a Variable, or the field of a Connection's extra JSON blob if the name contains
any words in ('access_token', 'api_key', 'apikey','authorization', 'passphrase', 'passwd',
'password', 'private_key', 'secret', 'token'). This list can also be extended:

.. code-block:: ini

    [core]
    sensitive_var_conn_names = comma,separated,sensitive,names

Adding your own masks
"""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to mask an additional secret that is already masked by one of the above methods, you can do it in
your DAG file or operator's ``execute`` function using the ``mask_secret`` function. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    @task
    def my_func():
        from airflow.utils.log.secrets_masker import mask_secret

        mask_secret("custom_value")

        ...

or

.. code-block:: python


    class MyOperator(BaseOperator):
        def execute(self, context):
            from airflow.utils.log.secrets_masker import mask_secret

            mask_secret("custom_value")

            ...

The mask must be set before any log/output is produced to have any effect.
