Building a Running Pipeline
===========================

Lets look at another example: we need to get some data from a file which is hosted online and insert it into our local database. We also need to look at removing duplicate rows while inserting.

Initial setup
-------------

We need to have Docker installed as we will be using the :doc:`/howto/docker-compose/index` procedure for this example.
The steps below should be sufficient, but see the quick-start documentation for full instructions.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Download the docker-compose.yaml file
  curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'

  # Make expected directories and set an expected environment variable
  mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
  echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

  # Initialize the database
  docker-compose up airflow-init

  # Start up all services
  docker-compose up

After all services have started up, the web UI will be available at: ``http://localhost:8080``. The default account has the username ``airflow`` and the password ``airflow``.

We will also need to create a `connection <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/connections.html>`_ to the postgres db. To create one via the web UI, from the "Admin" menu, select "Connections", then click the Plus sign to "Add a new record" to the list of connections.

Fill in the fields as shown below. Note the Connection Id value, which we'll pass as a parameter for the ``postgres_conn_id`` kwarg.

- Connection Id: tutorial_pg_conn
- Connection Type: postgres
- Host: postgres
- Schema: airflow
- Login: airflow
- Password: airflow
- Port: 5432

Test your connection and if the test is successful, save your connection.

Table Creation Tasks
--------------------

We can use the `PostgresOperator <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-postgres/stable/operators/postgres_operator_howto_guide.html#creating-a-postgres-database-table>`_ to define tasks that create tables in our postgres db.

We'll create one table to facilitate data cleaning steps (``employees_temp``) and another table to store our cleaned data (``employees``).

.. code-block:: python

  from airflow.providers.postgres.operators.postgres import PostgresOperator

  create_employees_table = PostgresOperator(
      task_id="create_employees_table",
      postgres_conn_id="tutorial_pg_conn",
      sql="""
          CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
              "Serial Number" NUMERIC PRIMARY KEY,
              "Company Name" TEXT,
              "Employee Markme" TEXT,
              "Description" TEXT,
              "Leave" INTEGER
          );""",
  )

  create_employees_temp_table = PostgresOperator(
      task_id="create_employees_temp_table",
      postgres_conn_id="tutorial_pg_conn",
      sql="""
          DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees_temp;
          CREATE TABLE employees_temp (
              "Serial Number" NUMERIC PRIMARY KEY,
              "Company Name" TEXT,
              "Employee Markme" TEXT,
              "Description" TEXT,
              "Leave" INTEGER
          );""",
  )

Optional: Using SQL From Files
------------------------------

If you want to abstract these sql statements out of your DAG, you can move the statements sql files somewhere within the ``dags/`` directory and pass the sql file_path (relative to ``dags/``) to the ``sql`` kwarg. For ``employees`` for example, create a ``sql`` directory in ``dags/``, put ``employees`` DDL in ``dags/sql/employees_schema.sql``, and modify the PostgresOperator() to:

.. code-block:: python

  create_employees_table = PostgresOperator(
      task_id="create_employees_table",
      postgres_conn_id="tutorial_pg_conn",
      sql="sql/employees_schema.sql",
  )

and repeat for the ``employees_temp`` table.

Data Retrieval Task
-------------------

Here we retrieve data, save it to a file on our Airflow instance, and load the data from that file into an intermediate table where we can execute data cleaning steps.

.. code-block:: python

  import os
  import requests
  from airflow.decorators import task
  from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook


  @task
  def get_data():
      # NOTE: configure this as appropriate for your airflow environment
      data_path = "/opt/airflow/dags/files/employees.csv"
      os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(data_path), exist_ok=True)

      url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/docs/apache-airflow/tutorial/pipeline_example.csv"

      response = requests.request("GET", url)

      with open(data_path, "w") as file:
          file.write(response.text)

      postgres_hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id="tutorial_pg_conn")
      conn = postgres_hook.get_conn()
      cur = conn.cursor()
      with open(data_path, "r") as file:
          cur.copy_expert(
              "COPY employees_temp FROM STDIN WITH CSV HEADER DELIMITER AS ',' QUOTE '\"'",
              file,
          )
      conn.commit()

Data Merge Task
---------------

Here we select completely unique records from the retrieved data, then we check to see if any employee ``Serial Numbers`` are already in the database (if they are, we update those records with the new data).

.. code-block:: python

  from airflow.decorators import task
  from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook


  @task
  def merge_data():
      query = """
          INSERT INTO employees
          SELECT *
          FROM (
              SELECT DISTINCT *
              FROM employees_temp
          )
          ON CONFLICT ("Serial Number") DO UPDATE
          SET "Serial Number" = excluded."Serial Number";
      """
      try:
          postgres_hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id="tutorial_pg_conn")
          conn = postgres_hook.get_conn()
          cur = conn.cursor()
          cur.execute(query)
          conn.commit()
          return 0
      except Exception as e:
          return 1



Completing our DAG
------------------

We've developed our tasks, now we need to wrap them in a DAG, which enables us to define when and how tasks should run, and state any dependencies that tasks have on other tasks. The DAG below is configured to:

* run every day at midnight starting on Jan 1, 2021,
* only run once in the event that days are missed, and
* timeout after 60 minutes

And from the last line in the definition of the ``process-employees`` DAG, we see:

.. code-block:: python

      [create_employees_table, create_employees_temp_table] >> get_data() >> merge_data()

* the ``merge_data()`` task depends on the ``get_data()`` task,
* the ``get_data()`` depends on both the ``create_employees_table`` and ``create_employees_temp_table`` tasks, and
* the ``create_employees_table`` and ``create_employees_temp_table`` tasks can run independently.

Putting all of the pieces together, we have our completed DAG.

  dag = ProcessEmployees()

Save this code to a python file in the ``/dags`` folder (e.g. ``dags/process-employees.py``) and (after a `brief delay <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#dag-dir-list-interval>`_), the ``process-employees`` DAG will be included in the list of available DAGs on the web UI.

.. image:: ../img/tutorial-pipeline-1.png

You can trigger the ``process-employees`` DAG by unpausing it (via the slider on the left end) and running it (via the Run button under **Actions**).

.. image:: ../img/tutorial-pipeline-2.png

In the ``process-employees`` DAG's **Grid** view, we see all that all tasks ran successfully in all executed runs. Success!

You now have a pipeline running inside Airflow using Docker Compose. Here are a few things you might want to do next:
