.. _executor:CeleryKubernetesExecutor:

CeleryKubernetes Executor
=========================

The :class:`~airflow.executors.celery_kubernetes_executor.CeleryKubernetesExecutor` allows users
to run simultaneously a ``CeleryExecutor`` and a ``KubernetesExecutor``.
An executor is chosen to run a task based on the task's queue.

``CeleryKubernetesExecutor`` inherits the scalability of the ``CeleryExecutor`` to
handle the high load at the peak time and runtime isolation of the ``KubernetesExecutor``.


When to use CeleryKubernetesExecutor
####################################

The ``CeleryKubernetesExecutor`` should only be used at certain cases, given that
it requires setting up the ``CeleryExecutor`` and the ``KubernetesExecutor``.

We recommend considering the ``CeleryKubernetesExecutor`` when your use case meets:

1. The number of tasks needed to be scheduled at the peak exceeds the scale that your Kubernetes cluster
   can comfortably handle

2. A relative small portion of your tasks requires runtime isolation.

3. You have plenty of small tasks that can be executed on Celery workers
   but you also have resource-hungry tasks that will be better to run in predefined environments.
