Executor
========

Executors are the mechanism by which task instances get run.

Airflow has support for various executors. Current used is determined by the ``executor`` option in the ``[core]``
section of the configuration file. This option should contain the name executor e.g. ``KubernetesExecutor``
if it is a core executor. If it is to load your own executor, then you should specify the
full path to the module e.g. ``my_acme_company.executors.MyCustomExecutor``.

.. note::
    For more information on setting the configuration, see :doc:`../howto/set-config`.

If you want to check which executor is currently set, you can use ``airflow config get-value core executor`` command as in
the example below.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ airflow config get-value core executor
    SequentialExecutor
