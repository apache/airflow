Prerequisites
-------------

Airflow is tested with:

* Python: 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

* Databases:

  * PostgreSQL:  9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13
  * MySQL: 5.7, 8
  * SQLite: 3.15.0+
  * MSSQL(Experimental): 2017, 2019

* Kubernetes: 1.18.15 1.19.7 1.20.2

**Note:** MySQL 5.x versions are unable to or have limitations with
running multiple schedulers -- please see: :doc:`/concepts/scheduler`. MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note:** SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Python v3.10 is not supported yet. For details, see `#19059 <https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19059>`__.

Starting with Airflow 2.1.2, Airflow is tested with Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

The minimum memory required we recommend Airflow to run with is 4GB, but the actual requirements depends
wildly on the deployment options you have
