Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We **highly** recommend installing the latest Airflow release which has richer features.


Support for Python and Kubernetes versions
``````````````````````````````````````````

As of Airflow 2.0 we agreed to certain rules we follow for Python and Kubernetes support.
They are based on the official release schedule of Python and Kubernetes, nicely summarized in the
`Python Developer's Guide <https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches>`_ and
`Kubernetes version skew policy <https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy>`_.

1. We drop support for Python and Kubernetes versions when they reach EOL. We drop support for those
   EOL versions in main right after EOL date, and it is effectively removed when we release the
   first new MINOR (Or MAJOR if there is no new MINOR version) of Airflow
   For example for Python 3.6 it means that we drop support in main right after 23.12.2021, and the first
   MAJOR or MINOR version of Airflow released after will not have it.

2. The "oldest" supported version of Python/Kubernetes is the default one. "Default" is only meaningful
   in terms of "smoke tests" in CI PRs which are run using this default version and default reference
   image available in DockerHub. Currently ``apache/airflow:latest`` and ``apache/airflow:2.0.2`` images
   are both Python 3.6 images, however the first MINOR/MAJOR release of Airflow release after 23.12.2021 will
   become Python 3.7 images.

3. We support a new version of Python/Kubernetes in main after they are officially released, as soon as we
   make them work in our CI pipeline (which might not be immediate due to dependencies catching up with
   new versions of Python mostly) we release a new images/support in Airflow based on the working CI setup.
