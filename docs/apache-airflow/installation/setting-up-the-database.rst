Setting up the database
-----------------------

Apache Airflowâ„¢ requires a database. If you're just experimenting and learning Airflow, you can stick with the
default SQLite option. If you don't want to use SQLite, then take a look at
:doc:`/howto/set-up-database` to setup a different database.

Usually, you need to run ``airflow db migrate`` in order to create the database schema if it does not exist
or migrate to the latest version if it does. You should make sure that Airflow components are
not running while the database migration is being executed.

.. note::

    Prior to Airflow version 2.7.0, ``airflow db upgrade`` was used to apply migrations,
    however, it has been deprecated in favor of ``airflow db migrate``.


In some deployments, such as :doc:`helm-chart:index`, both initializing and running the database migration
is executed automatically when Airflow is upgraded.

Sometimes, after the upgrade, you are also supposed to do some post-migration actions.
See :doc:`/installation/upgrading` for more details about upgrading and doing post-migration actions.
