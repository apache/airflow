Production Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is time to deploy your DAG in production. To do this, first, you need to make sure that the Airflow
is itself production-ready. Let's see what precautions you need to take.

Database backend
================

Airflow comes with an ``SQLite`` backend by default. This allows the user to run Airflow without any external
database. However, such a setup is meant to be used for testing purposes only; running the default setup
in production can lead to data loss in multiple scenarios. If you want to run production-grade Airflow,
make sure you :doc:`configure the backend <howto/set-up-database>` to be an external database
such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

You can change the backend using the following config

.. code-block:: ini

    [core]
    sql_alchemy_conn = my_conn_string

Once you have changed the backend, airflow needs to create all the tables required for operation.
Create an empty DB and give airflow's user the permission to ``CREATE/ALTER`` it.
Once that is done, you can run -

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow db upgrade

``upgrade`` keeps track of migrations already applied, so it's safe to run as often as you need.

.. note::

    Do not use ``airflow db init`` as it can create a lot of default connections, charts, etc. which are not
    required in production DB.


Multi-Node Cluster
==================

Airflow uses :class:`~airflow.executors.sequential_executor.SequentialExecutor` by default. However, by its
nature, the user is limited to executing at most one task at a time. ``Sequential Executor`` also pauses
the scheduler when it runs a task, hence it is not recommended in a production setup. You should use the
:class:`~airflow.executors.local_executor.LocalExecutor` for a single machine.
For a multi-node setup, you should use the :doc:`Kubernetes executor <../executor/kubernetes>` or
the :doc:`Celery executor <../executor/celery>`.


Once you have configured the executor, it is necessary to make sure that every node in the cluster contains
the same configuration and dags. Airflow sends simple instructions such as "execute task X of dag Y", but
does not send any dag files or configuration. You can use a simple cronjob or any other mechanism to sync
DAGs and configs across your nodes, e.g., checkout DAGs from git repo every 5 minutes on all nodes.


Logging
=======

If you are using disposable nodes in your cluster, configure the log storage to be a distributed file system
(DFS) such as ``S3`` and ``GCS``, or external services such as Stackdriver Logging, Elasticsearch or
Amazon CloudWatch. This way, the logs are available even after the node goes down or gets replaced.
See :doc:`logging-monitoring/logging-tasks` for configurations.

.. note::

    The logs only appear in your DFS after the task has finished. You can view the logs while the task is
    running in UI itself.


Configuration
=============

Airflow comes bundled with a default ``airflow.cfg`` configuration file.
You should use environment variables for configurations that change across deployments
e.g. metadata DB, password, etc. You can accomplish this using the format :envvar:`AIRFLOW__{SECTION}__{KEY}`

.. code-block:: bash

 AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=my_conn_id
 AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__BASE_URL=http://host:port

Some configurations such as the Airflow Backend connection URI can be derived from bash commands as well:

.. code-block:: ini

 sql_alchemy_conn_cmd = bash_command_to_run


Scheduler Uptime
================

Airflow users occasionally report instances of the scheduler hanging without a trace, for example in these issues:

* `Scheduler gets stuck without a trace <https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/7935>`_
* `Scheduler stopping frequently <https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13243>`_

Strategies for mitigation:

* When running on kubernetes, use a ``livenessProbe`` on the scheduler deployment to fail if the scheduler
  has not heartbeat in a while.
  `Example: <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/190066cf201e5b0442bbbd6df74efecae523ee76/chart/templates/scheduler/scheduler-deployment.yaml#L118-L136>`_.

.. _docker_image:

Production Container Images
===========================

Production-ready reference Image
--------------------------------

For the ease of deployment in production, the community releases a production-ready reference container
image.

The docker image provided (as convenience binary package) in the
`Apache Airflow DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow>`_ is a bare image
that has a few external dependencies and extras installed..

The Apache Airflow image provided as convenience package is optimized for size, so
it provides just a bare minimal set of the extras and dependencies installed and in most cases
you want to either extend or customize the image. You can see all possible extras in
:doc:`extra-packages-ref`. The set of extras used in Airflow Production image are available in the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2c6c7fdb2308de98e142618836bdf414df9768c8/Dockerfile#L39>`_.

The production images are build in DockerHub from released version and release candidates. There
are also images published from branches but they are used mainly for development and testing purpose.
See `Airflow Git Branching <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#airflow-git-branches>`_
for details.


Customizing or extending the Production Image
---------------------------------------------

Before you dive-deeply in the way how the Airflow Image is build, named and why we are doing it the
way we do, you might want to know very quickly how you can extend or customize the existing image
for Apache Airflow. This chapter gives you a short answer to those questions.

Airflow Summit 2020's `Production Docker Image <https://youtu.be/wDr3Y7q2XoI>`_ talk provides more
details about the context, architecture and customization/extension methods for the Production Image.

Extending the image
...................

Extending the image is easiest if you just need to add some dependencies that do not require
compiling. The compilation framework of Linux (so called ``build-essential``) is pretty big, and
for the production images, size is really important factor to optimize for, so our Production Image
does not contain ``build-essential``. If you need compiler like gcc or g++ or make/cmake etc. - those
are not found in the image and it is recommended that you follow the "customize" route instead.

How to extend the image - it is something you are most likely familiar with - simply
build a new image using Dockerfile's ``FROM`` directive and add whatever you need. Then you can add your
Debian dependencies with ``apt`` or PyPI dependencies with ``pip install`` or any other stuff you need.

You should be aware, about a few things:

* The production image of airflow uses "airflow" user, so if you want to add some of the tools
  as ``root`` user, you need to switch to it with ``USER`` directive of the Dockerfile. Also you
  should remember about following the
  `best practises of Dockerfiles <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/>`_
  to make sure your image is lean and small.

.. code-block:: dockerfile

  FROM apache/airflow:2.0.1
  USER root
  RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
           my-awesome-apt-dependency-to-add \
    && apt-get autoremove -yqq --purge \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  USER airflow


* PyPI dependencies in Apache Airflow are installed in the user library, of the "airflow" user, so
  you need to install them with the ``--user`` flag and WITHOUT switching to airflow user. Note also
  that using --no-cache-dir is a good idea that can help to make your image smaller.

.. code-block:: dockerfile

  FROM apache/airflow:2.0.1
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user my-awesome-pip-dependency-to-add

* As of 2.0.1 image the ``--user`` flag is turned on by default by setting ``PIP_USER`` environment variable
  to ``true``. This can be disabled by un-setting the variable or by setting it to ``false``.


* If your apt, or PyPI dependencies require some of the build-essentials, then your best choice is
  to follow the "Customize the image" route. However it requires to checkout sources of Apache Airflow,
  so you might still want to choose to add build essentials to your image, even if your image will
  be significantly bigger.

.. code-block:: dockerfile

  FROM apache/airflow:2.0.1
  USER root
  RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
           build-essential my-awesome-apt-dependency-to-add \
    && apt-get autoremove -yqq --purge \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  USER airflow
  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user my-awesome-pip-dependency-to-add


* You can also embed your dags in the image by simply adding them with COPY directive of Airflow.
  The DAGs in production image are in /opt/airflow/dags folder.

Customizing the image
.....................

Customizing the image is an alternative way of adding your own dependencies to the image - better
suited to prepare optimized production images.

The advantage of this method is that it produces optimized image even if you need some compile-time
dependencies that are not needed in the final image. You need to use Airflow Sources to build such images
from the `official distribution folder of Apache Airflow <https://downloads.apache.org/airflow/>`_ for the
released versions, or checked out from the GitHub project if you happen to do it from git sources.

The easiest way to build the image image is to use ``breeze`` script, but you can also build such customized
image by running appropriately crafted docker build in which you specify all the ``build-args``
that you need to add to customize it. You can read about all the args and ways you can build the image
in the `<#production-image-build-arguments>`_ chapter below.

Here just a few examples are presented which should give you general understanding of what you can customize.

This builds the production image in version 3.7 with additional airflow extras from 2.0.1 PyPI package and
additional apt dev and runtime dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE="python:3.7-slim-buster" \
    --build-arg PYTHON_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION=3.7 \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_INSTALLATION_METHOD="apache-airflow" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION="2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION_SPECIFICATION="==2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_REFERENCE="constraints-2-0" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_FROM="empty" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_TO="/empty" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_AIRFLOW_EXTRAS="jdbc" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_PYTHON_DEPS="pandas" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_DEV_APT_DEPS="gcc g++" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_RUNTIME_APT_DEPS="default-jre-headless" \
    --tag my-image


the same image can be built using ``breeze`` (it supports auto-completion of the options):

.. code-block:: bash

  ./breeze build-image \
      --production-image  --python 3.7 --install-airflow-version=2.0.1 \
      --additional-extras=jdbc --additional-python-deps="pandas" \
      --additional-dev-apt-deps="gcc g++" --additional-runtime-apt-deps="default-jre-headless"


You can customize more aspects of the image - such as additional commands executed before apt dependencies
are installed, or adding extra sources to install your dependencies from. You can see all the arguments
described below but here is an example of rather complex command to customize the image
based on example in `this comment <https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8605#issuecomment-690065621>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . -f Dockerfile \
    --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE="python:3.7-slim-buster" \
    --build-arg PYTHON_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION=3.7 \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_INSTALLATION_METHOD="apache-airflow" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION="2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION_SPECIFICATION="==2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_REFERENCE="constraints-2-0" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_FROM="empty" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_TO="/empty" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_AIRFLOW_EXTRAS="slack" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_PYTHON_DEPS="apache-airflow-backport-providers-odbc \
        apache-airflow-backport-providers-odbc \
        azure-storage-blob \
        sshtunnel \
        google-api-python-client \
        oauth2client \
        beautifulsoup4 \
        dateparser \
        rocketchat_API \
        typeform" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_DEV_APT_DEPS="msodbcsql17 unixodbc-dev g++" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_DEV_APT_COMMAND="curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | \
    apt-key add --no-tty - && \
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/10/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_DEV_ENV_VARS="ACCEPT_EULA=Y" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_RUNTIME_APT_COMMAND="curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | \
    apt-key add --no-tty - && \
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/10/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_RUNTIME_APT_DEPS="msodbcsql17 unixodbc git procps vim" \
    --build-arg ADDITIONAL_RUNTIME_ENV_VARS="ACCEPT_EULA=Y" \
    --tag my-image

Customizing images in high security restricted environments
...........................................................

You can also make sure your image is only build using local constraint file and locally downloaded
wheel files. This is often useful in Enterprise environments where the binary files are verified and
vetted by the security teams.

This builds below builds the production image in version 3.7 with packages and constraints used from the local
``docker-context-files`` rather than installed from PyPI or GitHub. It also disables MySQL client
installation as it is using external installation method.

Note that as a prerequisite - you need to have downloaded wheel files. In the example below we
first download such constraint file locally and then use ``pip download`` to get the .whl files needed
but in most likely scenario, those wheel files should be copied from an internal repository of such .whl
files. Note that ``AIRFLOW_VERSION_SPECIFICATION`` is only there for reference, the apache airflow .whl file
in the right version is part of the .whl files downloaded.

Note that 'pip download' will only works on Linux host as some of the packages need to be compiled from
sources and you cannot install them providing ``--platform`` switch. They also need to be downloaded using
the same python version as the target image.

The ``pip download`` might happen in a separate environment. The files can be committed to a separate
binary repository and vetted/verified by the security team and used subsequently to build images
of Airflow when needed on an air-gaped system.

Preparing the constraint files and wheel files:

.. code-block:: bash

  rm docker-context-files/*.whl docker-context-files/*.txt

  curl -Lo "docker-context-files/constraints-2-0.txt" \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2-0/constraints-3.7.txt

  pip download --dest docker-context-files \
    --constraint docker-context-files/constraints-2-0.txt  \
    apache-airflow[async,aws,azure,celery,dask,elasticsearch,gcp,kubernetes,mysql,postgres,redis,slack,ssh,statsd,virtualenv]==2.0.1

Since apache-airflow .whl packages are treated differently by the docker image, you need to rename the
downloaded apache-airflow* files, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   pushd docker-context-files
   for file in apache?airflow*
   do
     mv ${file} _${file}
   done
   popd

Building the image:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./breeze build-image \
      --production-image --python 3.7 --install-airflow-version=2.0.1 \
      --disable-mysql-client-installation --disable-pip-cache --install-from-local-files-when-building \
      --constraints-location="/docker-context-files/constraints-2-0.txt"

or

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --build-arg PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE="python:3.7-slim-buster" \
    --build-arg PYTHON_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION=3.7 \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_INSTALLATION_METHOD="apache-airflow" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION="2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_VERSION_SPECIFICATION="==2.0.1" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_REFERENCE="constraints-2-0" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_FROM="empty" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_SOURCES_TO="/empty" \
    --build-arg INSTALL_MYSQL_CLIENT="false" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_PRE_CACHED_PIP_PACKAGES="false" \
    --build-arg INSTALL_FROM_DOCKER_CONTEXT_FILES="true" \
    --build-arg AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_LOCATION="/docker-context-files/constraints-2-0.txt"


Customizing & extending the image together
..........................................

You can combine both - customizing & extending the image. You can build the image first using
``customize`` method (either with docker command or with ``breeze`` and then you can ``extend``
the resulting image using ``FROM`` any dependencies you want.

Customizing PYPI installation
.............................

You can customize PYPI sources used during image build by adding a docker-context-files/.pypirc file
This .pypirc will never be committed to the repository and will not be present in the final production image.
It is added and used only in the build segment of the image so it is never copied to the final image.

External sources for dependencies
---------------------------------

In corporate environments, there is often the need to build your Container images using
other than default sources of dependencies. The docker file uses standard sources (such as
Debian apt repositories or PyPI repository. However, in corporate environments, the dependencies
are often only possible to be installed from internal, vetted repositories that are reviewed and
approved by the internal security teams. In those cases, you might need to use those different
sources.

This is rather easy if you extend the image - you simply write your extension commands
using the right sources - either by adding/replacing the sources in apt configuration or
specifying the source repository in pip install command.

It's a bit more involved in the case of customizing the image. We do not have yet (but we are working
on it) a capability of changing the sources via build args. However, since the builds use
Dockerfile that is a source file, you can rather easily simply modify the file manually and
specify different sources to be used by either of the commands.


Comparing extending and customizing the image
---------------------------------------------

Here is the comparison of the two types of building images.

+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
|                                                    | Extending the image | Customizing the image |
+====================================================+=====================+=======================+
| Produces optimized image                           | No                  | Yes                   |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| Use Airflow Dockerfile sources to build the image  | No                  | Yes                   |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| Requires Airflow sources                           | No                  | Yes                   |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| You can build it with Breeze                       | No                  | Yes                   |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+
| Allows to use non-default sources for dependencies | Yes                 | No [1]                |
+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+

[1] When you combine customizing and extending the image, you can use external sources
in the "extend" part. There are plans to add functionality to add external sources
option to image customization. You can also modify Dockerfile manually if you want to
use non-default sources for dependencies.

Using the production image
--------------------------

The PROD image entrypoint works as follows:

* In case the user is not "airflow" (with undefined user id) and the group id of the user is set to 0 (root),
  then the user is dynamically added to /etc/passwd at entry using USER_NAME variable to define the user name.
  This is in order to accommodate the
  `OpenShift Guidelines <https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/guidelines.html>`_

* The ``AIRFLOW_HOME`` is set by default to ``/opt/airflow/`` - this means that DAGs
  are in default in the ``/opt/airflow/dags`` folder and logs are in the ``/opt/airflow/logs``

* The working directory is ``/opt/airflow`` by default.

* If ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable is passed to the container and it is either mysql or postgres
  SQL alchemy connection, then the connection is checked and the script waits until the database is reachable.
  If ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_CMD`` variable is passed to the container, it is evaluated as a
  command to execute and result of this evaluation is used as ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN``. The
  ``_CMD`` variable takes precedence over the ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable.

* If no ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable is set then SQLite database is created in
  ${AIRFLOW_HOME}/airflow.db and db reset is executed.

* If first argument equals to "bash" - you are dropped to a bash shell or you can executes bash command
  if you specify extra arguments. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 bash -c "ls -la"
  total 16
  drwxr-xr-x 4 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 .
  drwxr-xr-x 1 root    root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 ..
  drwxr-xr-x 2 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 dags
  drwxr-xr-x 2 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 logs

* If first argument is equal to "python" - you are dropped in python shell or python commands are executed if
  you pass extra parameters. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  > docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 python -c "print('test')"
  test

* If first argument equals to "airflow" - the rest of the arguments is treated as an airflow command
  to execute. Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 airflow webserver

* If there are any other arguments - they are simply passed to the "airflow" command

.. code-block:: bash

  > docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 version
  2.1.0.dev0

* If ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`` variable is passed and airflow command with
  scheduler, worker of flower command is used, then the script checks the broker connection
  and waits until the Celery broker database is reachable.
  If ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL_CMD`` variable is passed to the container, it is evaluated as a
  command to execute and result of this evaluation is used as ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL``. The
  ``_CMD`` variable takes precedence over the ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`` variable.

Production image build arguments
--------------------------------

The following build arguments (``--build-arg`` in docker build command) can be used for production images:

+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

There are build arguments that determine the installation mechanism of Apache Airflow for the
production image. There are three types of build:

* From local sources (by default for example when you use ``docker build .``)
* You can build the image from released PyPI airflow package (used to build the official Docker image)
* You can build the image from any version in GitHub repository(this is used mostly for system testing).

Actions executed at image start
-------------------------------

If you are using the default entrypoint of the production image,
there are a few actions that are automatically performed when the container starts.
In some cases, you can pass environment variables to the image to trigger some of that behaviour.

The variables that control the "execution" behaviour start with ``_AIRFLOW`` to distinguish them
from the variables used to build the image starting with ``AIRFLOW``.

Creating system user
....................

Airflow image is Open-Shift compatible, which means that you can start it with random user ID and group id 0.
Airflow will automatically create such a user and make it's home directory point to ``/home/airflow``.
You can read more about it in the "Support arbitrary user ids" chapter in the
`Openshift best practices <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images>`_.

Waits for Airflow DB connection
...............................

In case Postgres or MySQL DB is used, the entrypoint will wait until the airflow DB connection becomes
available. This happens always when you use the default entrypoint.

The script detects backend type depending on the URL schema and assigns default port numbers if not specified
in the URL. Then it loops until the connection to the host/port specified can be established
It tries ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT`` times and sleeps ``CONNECTION_CHECK_SLEEP_TIME`` between checks

Supported schemes:

* ``postgres://`` - default port 5432
* ``mysql://``    - default port 3306
* ``sqlite://``

In case of SQLite backend, there is no connection to establish and waiting is skipped.

Upgrading Airflow DB
....................

If you set ``_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE`` variable to a non-empty value, the entrypoint will run
the ``airflow db upgrade`` command right after verifying the connection. You can also use this
when you are running airflow with internal SQLite database (default) to upgrade the db and create
admin users at entrypoint, so that you can start the webserver immediately. Note - using SQLite is
intended only for testing purpose, never use SQLite in production as it has severe limitations when it
comes to concurrency.


Creating admin user
...................

The entrypoint can also create webserver user automatically when you enter it. you need to set
``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE`` to a non-empty value in order to do that. This is not intended for
production, it is only useful if you would like to run a quick test with the production image.
You need to pass at least password to create such user via ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD`` or
``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD`` similarly like for other ``*_CMD`` variables, the content of
the ``*_CMD`` will be evaluated as shell command and it's output will be set as password.

User creation will fail if none of the ``PASSWORD`` variables are set - there is no default for
password for security reasons.

+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter | Default                  | Environment variable                                                 |
+===========+==========================+======================================================================+
| username  | admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME``                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| password  |                          | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD`` or ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD`` |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| firstname | Airflow                  | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_FIRSTNAME``                                      |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| lastname  | Admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_LASTNAME``                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| email     | airflowadmin@example.com | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_EMAIL``                                          |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| role      | Admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_ROLE``                                           |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In case the password is specified, the user will be attempted to be created, but the entrypoint will
not fail if the attempt fails (this accounts for the case that the user is already created).

You can, for example start the webserver in the production image with initializing the internal SQLite
database and creating an ``admin/admin`` Admin user with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD=admin" \
      apache/airflow:master-python3.8 webserver


.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD=echo admin" \
      apache/airflow:master-python3.8 webserver

The commands above perform initialization of the SQLite database, create admin user with admin password
and Admin role. They also forward local port ``8080`` to the webserver port and finally start the webserver.


Waits for celery broker connection
..................................

In case Postgres or MySQL DB is used, and one of the ``scheduler``, ``celery``, ``worker``, or ``flower``
commands are used the entrypoint will wait until the celery broker DB connection is available.

The script detects backend type depending on the URL schema and assigns default port numbers if not specified
in the URL. Then it loops until connection to the host/port specified can be established
It tries ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT`` times and sleeps ``CONNECTION_CHECK_SLEEP_TIME`` between checks

Supported schemes:

* ``amqp(s)://``  (rabbitmq) - default port 5672
* ``redis://``               - default port 6379
* ``postgres://``            - default port 5432
* ``mysql://``               - default port 3306
* ``sqlite://``

In case of SQLite backend, there is no connection to establish and waiting is skipped.


Recipes
-------

Users sometimes share interesting ways of using the Docker images. We encourage users to contribute these
recipes to the documentation in case they prove useful to other members of the community by
submitting a pull request. The sections below capture this knowledge.

Google Cloud SDK installation
.............................

Some operators, such as :class:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.kubernetes_engine.GKEStartPodOperator`,
:class:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.dataflow.DataflowStartSqlJobOperator`, require
the installation of `Google Cloud SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk>`__ (includes ``gcloud``).
You can also run these commands with BashOperator.

Create a new Dockerfile like the one shown below.

.. exampleinclude:: /docker-images-recipes/gcloud.Dockerfile
    :language: dockerfile

Then build a new image.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --build-arg BASE_AIRFLOW_IMAGE="apache/airflow:2.0.1" \
    -t my-airflow-image


Apache Hadoop Stack installation
................................

Airflow is often used to run tasks on Hadoop cluster. It required Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run.
Below are the steps to take tools that are frequently used in Hadoop-world:

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Hive
- `Cloud Storage connector for Apache Hadoop <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage>`__


Create a new Dockerfile like the one shown below.

.. exampleinclude:: /docker-images-recipes/hadoop.Dockerfile
    :language: dockerfile

Then build a new image.

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build . \
    --build-arg BASE_AIRFLOW_IMAGE="apache/airflow:2.0.1" \
    -t my-airflow-image

More details about the images
-----------------------------

You can read more details about the images - the context, their parameters and internal structure in the
`IMAGES.rst <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/IMAGES.rst>`_ document.

.. _production-deployment:kerberos:

Kerberos-authenticated workers
==============================

Apache Airflow has a built-in mechanism for authenticating the operation with a KDC (Key Distribution Center).
Airflow has a separate command ``airflow kerberos`` that acts as token refresher. It uses the pre-configured
Kerberos Keytab to authenticate in the KDC to obtain a valid token, and then refreshing valid token
at regular intervals within the current token expiry window.

Each request for refresh uses a configured principal, and only keytab valid for the principal specified
is capable of retrieving the authentication token.

The best practice to implement proper security mechanism in this case is to make sure that worker
workloads have no access to the Keytab but only have access to the periodically refreshed, temporary
authentication tokens. This can be achieved in docker environment by running the ``airflow kerberos``
command and the worker command in separate containers - where only the ``airflow kerberos`` token has
access to the Keytab file (preferably configured as secret resource). Those two containers should share
a volume where the temporary token should be written by the ``airflow kerberos`` and read by the workers.

In the Kubernetes environment, this can be realized by the concept of side-car, where both Kerberos
token refresher and worker are part of the same Pod. Only the Kerberos side-car has access to
Keytab secret and both containers in the same Pod share the volume, where temporary token is written by
the side-care container and read by the worker container.

This concept is implemented in the development version of the Helm Chart that is part of Airflow source code.

Secured Server and Service Access on Google Cloud
=================================================

This section describes techniques and solutions for securely accessing servers and services when your Airflow
environment is deployed on Google Cloud, or you connect to Google services, or you are connecting
to the Google API.

IAM and Service Accounts
------------------------

You should not rely on internal network segmentation or firewalling as our primary security mechanisms.
To protect your organization's data, every request you make should contain sender identity. In the case of
Google Cloud, the identity is provided by
`the IAM and Service account <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts>`__. Each Compute Engine
instance has an associated service account identity. It provides cryptographic credentials that your workload
can use to prove its identity when making calls to Google APIs or third-party services. Each instance has
access only to short-lived credentials. If you use Google-managed service account keys, then the private
key is always held in escrow and is never directly accessible.

If you are using Kubernetes Engine, you can use
`Workload Identity <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity>`__ to assign
an identity to individual pods.

For more information about service accounts in the Airflow, see :ref:`howto/connection:gcp`

Impersonate Service Accounts
----------------------------

If you need access to other service accounts, you can
:ref:`impersonate other service accounts <howto/connection:gcp:impersonation>` to exchange the token with
the default identity to another service account. Thus, the account keys are still managed by Google
and cannot be read by your workload.

It is not recommended to generate service account keys and store them in the metadata database or the
secrets backend. Even with the use of the backend secret, the service account key is available for
your workload.

Access to Compute Engine Instance
---------------------------------

If you want to establish an SSH connection to the Compute Engine instance, you must have the network address
of this instance and credentials to access it. To simplify this task, you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.compute.ComputeEngineHook`
instead of :class:`~airflow.providers.ssh.hooks.ssh.SSHHook`

The :class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.compute.ComputeEngineHook` support authorization with
Google OS Login service. It is an extremely robust way to manage Linux access properly as it stores
short-lived ssh keys in the metadata service, offers PAM modules for access and sudo privilege checking
and offers the ``nsswitch`` user lookup into the metadata service as well.

It also solves the discovery problem that arises as your infrastructure grows. You can use the
instance name instead of the network address.

Access to Amazon Web Service
----------------------------

Thanks to the
`Web Identity Federation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc.html>`__,
you can exchange the Google Cloud Platform identity to the Amazon Web Service identity,
which effectively means access to Amazon Web Service platform.
