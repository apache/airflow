Kubernetes
----------

Kubernetes Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :doc:`Kubernetes Executor <executor/kubernetes>` allows you to run all the Airflow tasks on
Kubernetes as separate Pods.

KubernetesPodOperator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`KubernetesPodOperator <howto/operator:KubernetesPodOperator>` allows you to create
Pods on Kubernetes.

Pod Mutation Hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Airflow local settings file (``airflow_local_settings.py``) can define a ``pod_mutation_hook`` function
that has the ability to mutate pod objects before sending them to the Kubernetes client
for scheduling. It receives a single argument as a reference to pod objects, and
is expected to alter its attributes.

This could be used, for instance, to add sidecar or init containers
to every worker pod launched by KubernetesExecutor or KubernetesPodOperator.


.. code-block:: python

    def pod_mutation_hook(pod: Pod):
      pod.annotations['airflow.apache.org/launched-by'] = 'Tests'
