Params
======

Params are how Airflow provides runtime configuration to tasks.
When you trigger a DAG manually, you can modify its Params before the dagrun starts.
If the user-supplied values don't pass validation, Airflow shows a warning instead of creating the dagrun.
(For scheduled runs, the default values are used.)

Adding Params to a DAG
----------------------

To add Params to a :class:`~airflow.models.dag.DAG`, initialize it with the ``params`` kwarg.
Use a dictionary that maps Param names to a either a :class:`~airflow.models.param.Param` or an object indicating the parameter's default value.

.. code-block::

    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.models.param import Param

    with DAG(
        "the_dag",
        params={
            "x": Param(5, type="integer", minimum=3),
            "y": 6
        },
    ) as the_dag:

Referencing Params in a Task
----------------------------

Params are stored as ``params`` in the :ref:`template context <templates-ref>`.
So you can reference them in a template.

.. code-block::

    PythonOperator(
        task_id="from_template",
        op_args=[
            "{{ params.int_param + 10 }}",
        ],
        python_callable=(
            lambda x: print(x)
        ),
    )

Even though Params can use a variety of types, the default behavior of templates is to provide your task with a string.
You can change this by setting ``render_template_as_native_obj=True`` while initializing the :class:`~airflow.models.dag.DAG`.

.. code-block::

    with DAG(
        "the_dag",
        params={"x": Param(5, type="integer", minimum=3)},
        render_template_as_native_obj=True
    ) as the_dag:


This way, the Param's type is respected when its provided to your task.

.. code-block::

    # prints <class 'str'> by default
    # prints <class 'int'> if render_template_as_native_obj=True
    PythonOperator(
        task_id="template_type",
        op_args=[
            "{{ params.int_param }}",
        ],
        python_callable=(
            lambda x: print(type(x))
        ),
    )

Another way to access your param is via a task's ``context`` kwarg.

.. code-block::

    def print_x(**context):
        print(context["params"]["x"])

    PythonOperator(
        task_id="print_x",
        python_callable=print_x,
    )

Task-level Params
-----------------

You can also add Params to individual tasks.

.. code-block::

    PythonOperator(
        task_id="print_x",
        params={"x": 10},
        python_callable=print_it,
    )

If there's already a dag param with that name, the task-level default will take precedence over the dag-level default.
If a user supplies their own value when the DAG was triggered, Airflow ignores all defaults and uses the user's value.

JSON Schema Validation
----------------------

:class:`~airflow.modules.param.Param` makes use of ``json-schema <https://json-schema.org/>``, so you can use the full json-schema specifications mentioned at https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html to define ``Param`` objects.

.. code-block::

    with DAG(
        "my_dag",
        params={
            # a int with a default value
            "int_param": Param(10, type="integer", minimum=0, maximum=20),

            # a required param which can be of multiple types
            # a param must have a default value
            "dummy": Param(5, type=["null", "number", "string"]),

            # an enum param, must be one of three values
            "enum_param": Param("foo", enum=["foo", "bar", 42]),

            # a param which uses json-schema formatting
            "email": Param(
                default="example@example.com",
                type="string",
                format="idn-email",
                minLength=5,
                maxLength=255,
            ),
        },
    ) as my_dag:

.. note::
    As of now, for security reasons, one can not use Param objects derived out of custom classes. We are
    planning to have a registration system for custom Param classes, just like we've for Operator ExtraLinks.

Disabling Runtime Param Modification
------------------------------------

The ability to update params while triggering a DAG depends on the flag ``core.dag_run_conf_overrides_params``.
Setting this config to ``False`` will effectively turn your default params into constants.
