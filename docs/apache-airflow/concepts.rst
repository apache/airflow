The Airflow platform is a tool for describing, executing, and monitoring
workflows.

.. _architecture:

Basic Airflow architecture
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Primarily intended for development use, the basic Airflow architecture with the Local and Sequential executors is an
excellent starting point for understanding the architecture of Apache Airflow.

.. image:: img/arch-diag-basic.png


There are a few components to note:

* **Metadata Database**: Airflow uses a SQL database to store metadata about the data pipelines being run. In the
  diagram above, this is represented as Postgres which is extremely popular with Airflow.
  Alternate databases supported with Airflow include MySQL.

* **Web Server** and **Scheduler**: The Airflow web server and Scheduler are separate processes run (in this case)
  on the local machine and interact with the database mentioned above.

* The **Executor** is shown separately above, since it is commonly discussed within Airflow and in the documentation, but
  in reality it is NOT a separate process, but run within the Scheduler.

* The **Worker(s)** are separate processes which also interact with the other components of the Airflow architecture and
  the metadata repository.

* ``airflow.cfg`` is the Airflow configuration file which is accessed by the Web Server, Scheduler, and Workers.

* **DAGs** refers to the DAG files containing Python code, representing the data pipelines to be run by Airflow. The
  location of these files is specified in the Airflow configuration file, but they need to be accessible by the
  Web Server, Scheduler, and Workers.

Core Ideas
''''''''''

DAGs
====

In Airflow, a ``DAG`` -- or a Directed Acyclic Graph -- is a collection of all
the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships
and dependencies.

A DAG is defined in a Python script, which represents the DAGs structure (tasks
and their dependencies) as code.

For example, a simple DAG could consist of three tasks: A, B, and C. It could
say that A has to run successfully before B can run, but C can run anytime. It
could say that task A times out after 5 minutes, and B can be restarted up to 5
times in case it fails. It might also say that the workflow will run every night
at 10pm, but should not start until a certain date.

In this way, a DAG describes *how* you want to carry out your workflow; but
notice that we haven't said anything about *what* we actually want to do! A, B,
and C could be anything. Maybe A prepares data for B to analyze while C sends an
email. Or perhaps A monitors your location so B can open your garage door while
C turns on your house lights. The important thing is that the DAG isn't
concerned with what its constituent tasks do; its job is to make sure that
whatever they do happens at the right time, or in the right order, or with the
right handling of any unexpected issues.

DAGs are defined in standard Python files that are placed in Airflow's
``DAG_FOLDER``. Airflow will execute the code in each file to dynamically build
the ``DAG`` objects. You can have as many DAGs as you want, each describing an
arbitrary number of tasks. In general, each one should correspond to a single
logical workflow.

.. note:: When searching for DAGs, Airflow only considers Python files
   that contain the strings "airflow" and "dag" by default (case-insensitive).
   To consider all Python files instead, disable the ``DAG_DISCOVERY_SAFE_MODE``
   configuration flag.

.. _concepts:scope:

Scope
-----

Airflow will load any ``DAG`` object it can import from a DAGfile. Critically,
that means the DAG must appear in ``globals()``. Consider the following two
DAGs. Only ``dag_1`` will be loaded; the other one only appears in a local
scope.

.. code-block:: python

    dag_1 = DAG('this_dag_will_be_discovered')

    def my_function():
        dag_2 = DAG('but_this_dag_will_not')

    my_function()

Sometimes this can be put to good use. For example, a common pattern with
:class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator` is to define the subdag inside a function so that Airflow
doesn't try to load it as a standalone DAG.

.. _default-args:

Default Arguments
-----------------

If a dictionary of ``default_args`` is passed to a DAG, it will apply them to
any of its operators. This makes it easy to apply a common parameter to many operators without having to type it many times.

.. code-block:: python

    default_args = {
        'start_date': datetime(2016, 1, 1),
        'owner': 'airflow'
    }

    dag = DAG('my_dag', default_args=default_args)
    op = DummyOperator(task_id='dummy', dag=dag)
    print(op.owner) # Airflow

.. _concepts:context_manager:

Context Manager
---------------

*Added in Airflow 1.8*

DAGs can be used as context managers to automatically assign new operators to that DAG.

.. code-block:: python

    with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1)) as dag:
        op = DummyOperator('op')

    op.dag is dag # True

.. _concepts:task_flow_api:

TaskFlow API
------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0.0

Airflow 2.0 adds a new style of authoring dags called the TaskFlow API which removes a lot of the boilerplate
around creating PythonOperators, managing dependencies between task and accessing XCom values. (During
development this feature was called "Functional DAGs", so if you see or hear any references to that, it's the
same thing)

Outputs and inputs are sent between tasks using :ref:`XCom values <concepts:xcom>`. In addition, you can wrap
functions as tasks using the :ref:`task decorator <concepts:task_decorator>`. Airflow will also automatically
add dependencies between tasks to ensure that XCom messages are available when operators are executed.

Example DAG built with the TaskFlow API

.. code-block:: python

  with DAG(
      'send_server_ip', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval=None
  ) as dag:

    # Using default connection as it's set to httpbin.org by default
    get_ip = SimpleHttpOperator(
        task_id='get_ip', endpoint='get', method='GET', xcom_push=True
    )

    @dag.task(multiple_outputs=True)
    def prepare_email(raw_json: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
      external_ip = json.loads(raw_json)['origin']
      return {
        'subject':f'Server connected from {external_ip}',
        'body': f'Seems like today your server executing Airflow is connected from the external IP {external_ip}<br>'
      }

    email_info = prepare_email(get_ip.output)

    send_email = EmailOperator(
        task_id='send_email',
        to='example@example.com',
        subject=email_info['subject'],
        html_content=email_info['body']
    )

To retrieve current Task execution context dictionary and use it in the function check:
:ref:`Accessing context <concepts:accessing_context>`.

DAG decorator
-------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0.0

In addition to creating DAGs using :ref:`context manager <concepts:context_manager>`, in Airflow 2.0 you can also
create DAGs from a function. DAG decorator creates a DAG generator function. Any function decorated with ``@dag``
returns a DAG object.

DAG decorator also sets up the parameters you have in the function as DAG params. This allows you to parameterize
your DAGs and set the parameters when triggering the DAG manually. See
:ref:`Passing Parameters when triggering dags <dagrun:parameters>` to learn how to pass parameters when triggering DAGs.

You can also use the parameters on jinja templates by using the ``{{context.params}}`` dictionary.

Example DAG with decorator:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_dag_decorator.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START dag_decorator_usage]
    :end-before: [END dag_decorator_usage]

.. note:: Note that Airflow will only load DAGs that appear in ``globals()`` as noted in :ref:`scope section <concepts:scope>`.
  This means you need to make sure to have a variable for your returned DAG is in the module scope.
  Otherwise Airflow won't detect your decorated DAG.

.. _concepts:executor_config:

``executor_config``
===================

The ``executor_config`` is an argument placed into operators that allow airflow users to override tasks
before launch. Currently this is primarily used by the :class:`KubernetesExecutor`, but will soon be available
for other overrides.

.. _concepts:dagruns:

DAG Runs
========

A DAG run is an instantiation of a DAG, containing task instances that run for a specific ``execution_date``.

A DAG run is usually created by the Airflow scheduler, but can also be created by an external trigger.
Multiple DAG runs may be running at once for a particular DAG, each of them having a different ``execution_date``.
For example, we might currently have two DAG runs that are in progress for 2016-01-01 and 2016-01-02 respectively.

.. _concepts:execution_date:

execution_date
--------------

The ``execution_date`` is the *logical* date and time which the DAG Run, and its task instances, are running for.

This allows task instances to process data for the desired *logical* date & time.
While a task_instance or DAG run might have an *actual* start date of now,
their *logical* date might be 3 months ago because we are busy reloading something.

In the prior example the ``execution_date`` was 2016-01-01 for the first DAG Run and 2016-01-02 for the second.

A DAG run and all task instances created within it are instanced with the same ``execution_date``, so
that logically you can think of a DAG run as simulating the DAG running all of its tasks at some
previous date & time specified by the ``execution_date``.

.. _concepts:tasks:

Tasks
=====

A Task defines a unit of work within a DAG; it is represented as a node in the DAG graph, and it is written in Python.

Each task is an implementation of an Operator, for example a ``PythonOperator`` to execute some Python code,
or a ``BashOperator`` to run a Bash command.

The task implements an operator by defining specific values for that operator,
such as a Python callable in the case of ``PythonOperator`` or a Bash command in the case of ``BashOperator``.

Relations between Tasks
-----------------------

Consider the following DAG with two tasks.
Each task is a node in our DAG, and there is a dependency from task_1 to task_2:

.. code-block:: python

    with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1)) as dag:
        task_1 = DummyOperator('task_1')
        task_2 = DummyOperator('task_2')
        task_1 >> task_2 # Define dependencies

We can say that task_1 is *upstream* of task_2, and conversely task_2 is *downstream* of task_1.
When a DAG Run is created, task_1 will start running and task_2 waits for task_1 to complete successfully before it may start.

.. _concepts:task_decorator:

Python task decorator
---------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0.0

Airflow ``task`` decorator converts any Python function to an Airflow operator.
The decorated function can be called once to set the arguments and key arguments for operator execution.

.. code-block:: python

  with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2020, 5, 15)) as dag:
      @dag.task
      def hello_world():
          print('hello world!')


      # Also...
      from airflow.decorators import task


      @task
      def hello_name(name: str):
          print(f'hello {name}!')


      hello_name('Airflow users')

Task decorator captures returned values and sends them to the :ref:`XCom backend <concepts:xcom>`. By default,
the returned value is saved as a single XCom value. You can set ``multiple_outputs`` key argument to ``True``
to unroll dictionaries, lists or tuples into separate XCom values. This can be used with regular operators to
create :ref:`DAGs with Task Flow API <concepts:task_flow_api>`.

Calling a decorated function returns an ``XComArg`` instance. You can use it to set templated fields on downstream
operators.

You can call a decorated function more than once in a DAG. The decorated function will automatically generate
a unique ``task_id`` for each generated operator.

.. code-block:: python

  with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2020, 5, 15)) as dag:

    @dag.task
    def update_user(user_id: int):
      ...

    # Avoid generating this list dynamically to keep DAG topology stable between DAG runs
    for user_id in user_ids:
      update_user(user_id)

    # This will generate an operator for each user_id

Task ids are generated by appending a number at the end of the original task id. For the above example, the DAG will have
the following task ids: ``[update_user, update_user__1, update_user__2, ... update_user__n]``.

Due to dynamic nature of the ids generations users should be aware that changing a DAG by adding or removing additional
invocations of task-decorated function may change ``task_id`` of other task of the same type within a single DAG.

For example, if there are many task-decorated tasks without explicitly given task_id. Their ``task_id`` will be
generated sequentially: ``task__1``, ``task__2``, ``task__3``, etc. After the DAG goes into production, one day
someone inserts a new task before ``task__2``. The ``task_id`` after that will all be shifted forward by one place.
This is going to produce ``task__1``, ``task__2``, ``task__3``, ``task__4``. But at this point the ``task__3`` is
no longer the same ``task__3`` as before. This may create confusion when analyzing history logs / DagRuns of a DAG
that changed over time.

.. _concepts:accessing_context:

Accessing current context
-------------------------

To retrieve current execution context you can use ``get_current_context`` method. In this way
you can gain access to context dictionary from within your operators. This is especially helpful when
using ``@task`` decorator.

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.operators.python import task, get_current_context

    @task
    def my_task():
        context = get_current_context()
        ti = context["ti"]

Current context is accessible only during the task execution. The context is not accessible during
``pre_execute`` or ``post_execute``. Calling this method outside execution context will raise an error.

The context dictionary contains the keys mentioned in the table: :doc:`macros-ref`.

Task Instances
==============

A task instance represents a specific run of a task and is characterized as the
combination of a DAG, a task, and a point in time (``execution_date``). Task instances
also have an indicative state, which could be "running", "success", "failed", "skipped", "up
for retry", etc.

Tasks are defined in DAGs, and both are written in Python code to define what you want to do.
Task Instances belong to DAG Runs, have an associated ``execution_date``, and are instantiated, runnable entities.

Relations between Task Instances
--------------------------------

Again consider the following tasks, defined for some DAG:

.. code-block:: python

    with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1)) as dag:
        task_1 = DummyOperator('task_1')
        task_2 = DummyOperator('task_2')
        task_1 >> task_2 # Define dependencies

When we enable this DAG, the scheduler creates several DAG Runs - one with ``execution_date`` of 2016-01-01,
one with ``execution_date`` of 2016-01-02, and so on up to the current date.

Each DAG Run will contain a task_1 Task Instance and a task_2 Task instance. Both Task Instances will
have ``execution_date`` equal to the DAG Run's ``execution_date``, and each task_2 will be *downstream* of
(depends on) its task_1.

We can also say that task_1 for 2016-01-01 is the *previous* task instance of the task_1 for 2016-01-02.
Or that the DAG Run for 2016-01-01 is the *previous* DAG Run to the DAG Run of 2016-01-02.
Here, *previous* refers to the logical past/prior ``execution_date``, that runs independently of other runs,
and *upstream* refers to a dependency within the same run and having the same ``execution_date``.

.. note::
    The Airflow documentation sometimes refers to *previous* instead of *upstream* in places, and vice-versa.
    If you find any occurrences of this, please help us improve by contributing some corrections!

Task Lifecycle
==============

A task goes through various stages from start to completion. In the Airflow UI
(graph and tree views), these stages are displayed by a color representing each
stage:

.. image:: img/task_stages.png

The complete lifecycle of the task looks like this:

.. image:: img/task_lifecycle_diagram.png

The happy flow consists of the following stages:

1. No status (scheduler created empty task instance)
2. Scheduled (scheduler determined task instance needs to run)
3. Queued (scheduler sent task to executor to run on the queue)
4. Running (worker picked up a task and is now running it)
5. Success (task completed)

.. _concepts:operators:

Operators
=========

While DAGs describe *how* to run a workflow, ``Operators`` determine what
actually gets done by a task.

An operator describes a single task in a workflow. Operators are usually (but
not always) atomic, meaning they can stand on their own and don't need to share
resources with any other operators. The DAG will make sure that operators run in
the correct order; other than those dependencies, operators generally
run independently. In fact, they may run on two completely different machines.

This is a subtle but very important point: in general, if two operators need to
share information, like a filename or small amount of data, you should consider
combining them into a single operator. If it absolutely can't be avoided,
Airflow does have a feature for operator cross-communication called XCom that is
described in the section :ref:`XComs <concepts:xcom>`

Airflow provides many built-in operators for many common tasks, including:

- :class:`~airflow.operators.bash.BashOperator` - executes a bash command
- :class:`~airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator` - calls an arbitrary Python function
- :class:`~airflow.operators.email.EmailOperator` - sends an email

There are also other, commonly used operators that are installed together with airflow automatically,
by pre-installing some :doc:`apache-airflow-providers:index` packages (they are always available no
matter which extras you chose when installing Apache Airflow):

- :class:`~airflow.providers.http.operators.http.SimpleHttpOperator` - sends an HTTP request
- :class:`~airflow.providers.sqlite.operators.sqlite.SqliteOperator` - SQLite DB operator

In addition to these basic building blocks, there are many more specific operators developed by the
community that you can install additionally by installing community-maintained provider packages. You
can install them by adding an extra (for example (``[mysql]``) when installing Airflow or by installing
additional packages manually (for example ``apache-airflow-providers-mysql`` package).

Some examples of popular operators are:

- :class:`~airflow.providers.mysql.operators.mysql.MySqlOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.postgres.operators.postgres.PostgresOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.microsoft.mssql.operators.mssql.MsSqlOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.oracle.operators.oracle.OracleOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.jdbc.operators.jdbc.JdbcOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker.DockerOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.hive.operators.hive.HiveOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.s3_file_transform.S3FileTransformOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.mysql.transfers.presto_to_mysql.PrestoToMySqlOperator`
- :class:`~airflow.providers.slack.operators.slack.SlackAPIOperator`

But there are many, many more - you can see the list of those by following the providers documentation
at :doc:`apache-airflow-providers:index`.

Operators are only loaded by Airflow if they are assigned to a DAG.

.. seealso::
    - :ref:`List Airflow operators <pythonapi:operators>`
    - :doc:`How-to guides for some Airflow operators<howto/operator/index>`

.. _concepts:sensors:

Sensors
-------

``Sensor`` is an Operator that waits (polls) for a certain time, file, database row, S3 key, another DAG/task, etc...

There are currently 3 different modes for how a sensor operates:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Schedule Mode
     - Description
     - Use case
   * - ``poke`` (default)
     - The sensor is taking up a worker slot for its whole execution time and sleeps between pokes.
     - Use this mode if the expected runtime of the sensor is short or if a short poke interval is required.
       Note that the sensor will hold onto a worker slot and a pool slot for the duration of the sensor's
       runtime in this mode.
   * - ``reschedule``
     - The sensor task frees the worker slot when the criteria is not yet met and it's rescheduled at a later time.
     - Use this mode if the time before the criteria is met is expected to be quite long.
       The poke interval should be more than one minute to prevent too much load on the scheduler.
   * - ``smart sensor``
     - smart sensor is a service (run by a builtin DAG) which consolidate the execution of sensors in batches.
       Instead of holding a long running process for each sensor and poking periodically, a sensor will only
       store poke context at ``sensor_instance`` table and then exits with a 'sensing' state.
     - Use this mode if you have a large amount of sensor tasks running in your airflow cluster.
       This can largely reduce airflow’s infrastructure cost and improve cluster stability - reduce meta database load.

How to use:

For ``poke|schedule`` mode, you can configure them at the task level by supplying the ``mode`` parameter,
i.e. ``S3KeySensor(task_id='check-bucket', mode='reschedule', ...)``.

For ``smart sensor``, you need to configure it in ``airflow.cfg``, for example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [smart_sensor]
    use_smart_sensor = true
    shard_code_upper_limit = 10000

    # Users can change the following config based on their requirements
    shards = 5
    sensors_enabled = NamedHivePartitionSensor, MetastorePartitionSensor

For more information on how to configure ``smart-sensor`` and its architecture, see:
:doc:`Smart Sensor Architecture and Configuration<smart-sensor>`

DAG Assignment
--------------

*Added in Airflow 1.8*

Operators do not have to be assigned to DAGs immediately (previously ``dag`` was
a required argument). However, once an operator is assigned to a DAG, it can not
be transferred or unassigned. DAG assignment can be done explicitly when the
operator is created, through deferred assignment, or even inferred from other
operators.

.. code-block:: python

    dag = DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1))

    # sets the DAG explicitly
    explicit_op = DummyOperator(task_id='op1', dag=dag)

    # deferred DAG assignment
    deferred_op = DummyOperator(task_id='op2')
    deferred_op.dag = dag

    # inferred DAG assignment (linked operators must be in the same DAG)
    inferred_op = DummyOperator(task_id='op3')
    inferred_op.set_upstream(deferred_op)


Bitshift Composition
--------------------

*Added in Airflow 1.8*

We recommend you setting operator relationships with bitshift operators rather than ``set_upstream()``
and ``set_downstream()``.

Traditionally, operator relationships are set with the ``set_upstream()`` and
``set_downstream()`` methods. In Airflow 1.8, this can be done with the Python
bitshift operators ``>>`` and ``<<``. The following four statements are all
functionally equivalent:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> op2
    op1.set_downstream(op2)

    op2 << op1
    op2.set_upstream(op1)

When using the bitshift to compose operators, the relationship is set in the
direction that the bitshift operator points. For example, ``op1 >> op2`` means
that ``op1`` runs first and ``op2`` runs second. Multiple operators can be
composed -- keep in mind the chain is executed left-to-right and the rightmost
object is always returned. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> op2 >> op3 << op4

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    op1.set_downstream(op2)
    op2.set_downstream(op3)
    op3.set_upstream(op4)

We can put this all together to build a simple pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

    with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2016, 1, 1)) as dag:
        (
            DummyOperator(task_id='dummy_1')
            >> BashOperator(
                task_id='bash_1',
                bash_command='echo "HELLO!"')
            >> PythonOperator(
                task_id='python_1',
                python_callable=lambda: print("GOODBYE!"))
        )

Bitshift can also be used with lists. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> [op2, op3] >> op4

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> op2 >> op4
    op1 >> op3 >> op4

and equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    op1.set_downstream([op2, op3])
    op4.set_upstream([op2, op3])


Relationship Builders
---------------------

*Moved in Airflow 2.0*

In Airflow 2.0 those two methods moved from ``airflow.utils.helpers`` to ``airflow.models.baseoperator``.

``chain`` and ``cross_downstream`` function provide easier ways to set relationships
between operators in specific situation.

When setting a relationship between two lists,
if we want all operators in one list to be upstream to all operators in the other,
we cannot use a single bitshift composition. Instead we have to split one of the lists:

.. code-block:: python

    [op1, op2, op3] >> op4
    [op1, op2, op3] >> op5
    [op1, op2, op3] >> op6

``cross_downstream`` could handle list relationships easier.

.. code-block:: python

    cross_downstream([op1, op2, op3], [op4, op5, op6])

When setting single direction relationships to many operators, we could
concat them with bitshift composition.

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> op2 >> op3 >> op4 >> op5

This can be accomplished using ``chain``

.. code-block:: python

    chain(op1, op2, op3, op4, op5)

even without operator's name

.. code-block:: python

    chain([DummyOperator(task_id='op' + i, dag=dag) for i in range(1, 6)])

``chain`` can handle a list of operators

.. code-block:: python

    chain(op1, [op2, op3], op4)

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> [op2, op3] >> op4

When ``chain`` sets relationships between two lists of operators, they must have the same size.

.. code-block:: python

    chain(op1, [op2, op3], [op4, op5], op6)

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    op1 >> [op2, op3]
    op2 >> op4
    op3 >> op5
    [op4, op5] >> op6


Workflows
=========

You're now familiar with the core building blocks of Airflow.
Some of the concepts may sound very similar, but the vocabulary can
be conceptualized like this:

- DAG: The work (tasks), and the order in which
  work should take place (dependencies), written in Python.
- DAG Run: An instance of a DAG for a particular logical date and time.
- Operator: A class that acts as a template for carrying out some work.
- Task: Defines work by implementing an operator, written in Python.
- Task Instance: An instance of a task - that has been assigned to a DAG and has a
  state associated with a specific DAG run (i.e for a specific execution_date).
- execution_date: The logical date and time for a DAG Run and its Task Instances.

By combining ``DAGs`` and ``Operators`` to create ``TaskInstances``, you can
build complex workflows.

Additional Functionality
''''''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to the core Airflow objects, there are a number of more complex
features that enable behaviors like limiting simultaneous access to resources,
cross-communication, conditional execution, and more.

Hooks
=====

Hooks are interfaces to external platforms and databases like Hive, S3,
MySQL, Postgres, HDFS, and Pig. Hooks implement a common interface when
possible, and act as a building block for operators. They also use
the ``airflow.models.connection.Connection`` model to retrieve hostnames
and authentication information. Hooks keep authentication code and
information out of pipelines, centralized in the metadata database.

Hooks are also very useful on their own to use in Python scripts,
Airflow airflow.operators.PythonOperator, and in interactive environments
like iPython or Jupyter Notebook.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`List Airflow hooks <pythonapi:hooks>`

Pools
=====

Some systems can get overwhelmed when too many processes hit them at the same
time. Airflow pools can be used to **limit the execution parallelism** on
arbitrary sets of tasks. The list of pools is managed in the UI
(``Menu -> Admin -> Pools``) by giving the pools a name and assigning
it a number of worker slots. Tasks can then be associated with
one of the existing pools by using the ``pool`` parameter when
creating tasks (i.e., instantiating operators).

.. code-block:: python

    aggregate_db_message_job = BashOperator(
        task_id='aggregate_db_message_job',
        execution_timeout=timedelta(hours=3),
        pool='ep_data_pipeline_db_msg_agg',
        bash_command=aggregate_db_message_job_cmd,
        dag=dag)
    aggregate_db_message_job.set_upstream(wait_for_empty_queue)

The ``pool`` parameter can
be used in conjunction with ``priority_weight`` to define priorities
in the queue, and which tasks get executed first as slots open up in the
pool. The default ``priority_weight`` is ``1``, and can be bumped to any
number. When sorting the queue to evaluate which task should be executed
next, we use the ``priority_weight``, summed up with all of the
``priority_weight`` values from tasks downstream from this task. You can
use this to bump a specific important task and the whole path to that task
gets prioritized accordingly.

Tasks will be scheduled as usual while the slots fill up. Once capacity is
reached, runnable tasks get queued and their state will show as such in the
UI. As slots free up, queued tasks start running based on the
``priority_weight`` (of the task and its descendants).

Note that if tasks are not given a pool, they are assigned to a default
pool ``default_pool``.  ``default_pool`` is initialized with 128 slots and
can changed through the UI or CLI (though it cannot be removed).

To combine Pools with SubDAGs see the `SubDAGs`_ section.

.. _concepts-connections:

Connections
===========

The information needed to connect to external systems is stored in the Airflow metastore database and can be
managed in the UI (``Menu -> Admin -> Connections``).  A ``conn_id`` is defined there, and hostname / login /
password / schema information attached to it.  Airflow pipelines retrieve centrally-managed connections
information by specifying the relevant ``conn_id``.

Airflow also provides a mechanism to store connections outside the database, e.g. in :ref:`environment variables <environment_variables_secrets_backend>`.
Additional sources may be enabled, e.g. :ref:`AWS SSM Parameter Store <ssm_parameter_store_secrets>`, or you may
:ref:`roll your own secrets backend <roll_your_own_secrets_backend>`.

Many hooks have a default ``conn_id``, where operators using that hook do not
need to supply an explicit connection ID. For example, the default
``conn_id`` for the :class:`~airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres.PostgresHook` is
``postgres_default``.

See :doc:`howto/connection` for details on creating and managing connections.

.. _concepts:xcom:

XComs
=====

XComs let tasks exchange messages, allowing more nuanced forms of control and
shared state. The name is an abbreviation of "cross-communication". XComs are
principally defined by a key, value, and timestamp, but also track attributes
like the task/DAG that created the XCom and when it should become visible. Any
object that can be pickled can be used as an XCom value, so users should make
sure to use objects of appropriate size.

XComs can be "pushed" (sent) or "pulled" (received). When a task pushes an
XCom, it makes it generally available to other tasks. Tasks can push XComs at
any time by calling the ``xcom_push()`` method. In addition, if a task returns
a value (either from its Operator's ``execute()`` method, or from a
PythonOperator's ``python_callable`` function), then an XCom containing that
value is automatically pushed.

Tasks call ``xcom_pull()`` to retrieve XComs, optionally applying filters
based on criteria like ``key``, source ``task_ids``, and source ``dag_id``. By
default, ``xcom_pull()`` filters for the keys that are automatically given to
XComs when they are pushed by being returned from execute functions (as
opposed to XComs that are pushed manually).

If ``xcom_pull`` is passed a single string for ``task_ids``, then the most
recent XCom value from that task is returned; if a list of ``task_ids`` is
passed, then a corresponding list of XCom values is returned.

.. code-block:: python

    # inside a PythonOperator called 'pushing_task'
    def push_function():
        return value

    # inside another PythonOperator
    def pull_function(task_instance):
        value = task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='pushing_task')

When specifying arguments that are part of the context, they will be
automatically passed to the function.

It is also possible to pull XCom directly in a template, here's an example
of what this may look like:

.. code-block:: jinja

    SELECT * FROM {{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='foo', key='table_name') }}

Note that XComs are similar to `Variables`_, but are specifically designed
for inter-task communication rather than global settings.

Custom XCom backend
-------------------

It is possible to change ``XCom`` behaviour of serialization and deserialization of tasks' result.
To do this one have to change ``xcom_backend`` parameter in Airflow config. Provided value should point
to a class that is subclass of :class:`~airflow.models.xcom.BaseXCom`. To alter the serialization /
deserialization mechanism the custom class should override ``serialize_value`` and ``deserialize_value``
methods.

It is also possible to override the ``orm_deserialize_value`` method which is used for deserialization when
recreating ORM XCom object. This happens every time we query the XCom table, for example when we want to populate
XCom list view in webserver. If your XCom backend performs expensive operations, or has large values that are not
useful to show in such a view, override this method to provide an alternative representation. By default Airflow will
use ``BaseXCom.orm_deserialize_value`` method which returns the value stored in Airflow database.

See :doc:`modules_management` for details on how Python and Airflow manage modules.

.. _concepts:variables:

Variables
=========

Variables are a generic way to store and retrieve arbitrary content or
settings as a simple key value store within Airflow. Variables can be
listed, created, updated and deleted from the UI (``Admin -> Variables``),
code or CLI. In addition, json settings files can be bulk uploaded through
the UI. While your pipeline code definition and most of your constants
and variables should be defined in code and stored in source control,
it can be useful to have some variables or configuration items
accessible and modifiable through the UI.


.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.models import Variable
    foo = Variable.get("foo")
    bar = Variable.get("bar", deserialize_json=True)
    baz = Variable.get("baz", default_var=None)

The second call assumes ``json`` content and will be deserialized into
``bar``. Note that ``Variable`` is a sqlalchemy model and can be used
as such. The third call uses the ``default_var`` parameter with the value
``None``, which either returns an existing value or ``None`` if the variable
isn't defined. The get function will throw a ``KeyError`` if the variable
doesn't exist and no default is provided.

You can use a variable from a jinja template with the syntax :

.. code-block:: bash

    echo {{ var.value.<variable_name> }}

or if you need to deserialize a json object from the variable :

.. code-block:: bash

    echo {{ var.json.<variable_name> }}

See :doc:`howto/variable` for details on managing variables.

Branching
=========

Sometimes you need a workflow to branch, or only go down a certain path
based on an arbitrary condition which is typically related to something
that happened in an upstream task. One way to do this is by using the
``BranchPythonOperator``.

The ``BranchPythonOperator`` is much like the PythonOperator except that it
expects a ``python_callable`` that returns a task_id (or list of task_ids). The
task_id returned is followed, and all of the other paths are skipped.
The task_id returned by the Python function has to reference a task
directly downstream from the BranchPythonOperator task.

Note that when a path is a downstream task of the returned task (list), it will
not be skipped:

.. image:: img/branch_note.png

Paths of the branching task are ``branch_a``, ``join`` and ``branch_b``. Since
``join`` is a downstream task of ``branch_a``, it will be excluded from the skipped
tasks when ``branch_a`` is returned by the Python callable.

The ``BranchPythonOperator`` can also be used with XComs allowing branching
context to dynamically decide what branch to follow based on upstream tasks.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

  def branch_func(ti):
      xcom_value = int(ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='start_task'))
      if xcom_value >= 5:
          return 'continue_task'
      else:
          return 'stop_task'

  start_op = BashOperator(
      task_id='start_task',
      bash_command="echo 5",
      xcom_push=True,
      dag=dag)

  branch_op = BranchPythonOperator(
      task_id='branch_task',
      python_callable=branch_func,
      dag=dag)

  continue_op = DummyOperator(task_id='continue_task', dag=dag)
  stop_op = DummyOperator(task_id='stop_task', dag=dag)

  start_op >> branch_op >> [continue_op, stop_op]

If you wish to implement your own operators with branching functionality, you
can inherit from :class:`~airflow.operators.branch.BaseBranchOperator`,
which behaves similarly to ``BranchPythonOperator`` but expects you to provide
an implementation of the method ``choose_branch``. As with the callable for
``BranchPythonOperator``, this method should return the ID of a downstream task,
or a list of task IDs, which will be run, and all others will be skipped.

.. code-block:: python

  class MyBranchOperator(BaseBranchOperator):
      def choose_branch(self, context):
          """
          Run an extra branch on the first day of the month
          """
          if context['execution_date'].day == 1:
              return ['daily_task_id', 'monthly_task_id']
          else:
              return 'daily_task_id'


SubDAGs
=======

SubDAGs are perfect for repeating patterns. Defining a function that returns a
DAG object is a nice design pattern when using Airflow.

Airbnb uses the *stage-check-exchange* pattern when loading data. Data is staged
in a temporary table, after which data quality checks are performed against
that table. Once the checks all pass the partition is moved into the production
table.

As another example, consider the following DAG:

.. image:: img/subdag_before.png

We can combine all of the parallel ``task-*`` operators into a single SubDAG,
so that the resulting DAG resembles the following:

.. image:: img/subdag_after.png

Note that SubDAG operators should contain a factory method that returns a DAG
object. This will prevent the SubDAG from being treated like a separate DAG in
the main UI. For example:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/subdags/subdag.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START subdag]
    :end-before: [END subdag]

This SubDAG can then be referenced in your main DAG file:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_subdag_operator.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START example_subdag_operator]
    :end-before: [END example_subdag_operator]

You can zoom into a :class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator` from the graph view of the main DAG to show
the tasks contained within the SubDAG:

.. image:: img/subdag_zoom.png

Some other tips when using SubDAGs:

-  by convention, a SubDAG's ``dag_id`` should be prefixed by its parent and
   a dot. As in ``parent.child``
-  share arguments between the main DAG and the SubDAG by passing arguments to
   the SubDAG operator (as demonstrated above)
-  SubDAGs must have a schedule and be enabled. If the SubDAG's schedule is
   set to ``None`` or ``@once``, the SubDAG will succeed without having done
   anything
-  clearing a :class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator` also clears the state of the tasks within
-  marking success on a :class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator` does not affect the state of the tasks
   within
-  refrain from using ``depends_on_past=True`` in tasks within the SubDAG as
   this can be confusing
-  it is possible to specify an executor for the SubDAG. It is common to use
   the SequentialExecutor if you want to run the SubDAG in-process and
   effectively limit its parallelism to one. Using LocalExecutor can be
   problematic as it may over-subscribe your worker, running multiple tasks in
   a single slot

See ``airflow/example_dags`` for a demonstration.

Note that airflow pool is not honored by :class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator`. Hence
resources could be consumed by SubdagOperators.


TaskGroup
=========
TaskGroup can be used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups in Graph View. It is
useful for creating repeating patterns and cutting down visual clutter. Unlike
:class:`~airflow.operators.subdag.SubDagOperator`, TaskGroup is a UI grouping concept.
Tasks in TaskGroups live on the same original DAG. They honor all the pool configurations.

Dependency relationships can be applied across all tasks in a TaskGroup with the ``>>`` and ``<<``
operators. For example, the following code puts ``task1`` and ``task2`` in TaskGroup ``group1``
and then puts both tasks upstream of ``task3``:

.. code-block:: python

    with TaskGroup("group1") as group1:
        task1 = DummyOperator(task_id="task1")
        task2 = DummyOperator(task_id="task2")

    task3 = DummyOperator(task_id="task3")

    group1 >> task3

.. note::
   By default, child tasks and TaskGroups have their task_id and group_id prefixed with the
   group_id of their parent TaskGroup. This ensures uniqueness of group_id and task_id throughout
   the DAG. To disable the prefixing, pass ``prefix_group_id=False`` when creating the TaskGroup.
   This then gives the user full control over the actual group_id and task_id. They have to ensure
   group_id and task_id are unique throughout the DAG. The option ``prefix_group_id=False`` is
   mainly useful for putting tasks on existing DAGs into TaskGroup without altering their task_id.

Here is a more complicated example DAG with multiple levels of nested TaskGroups:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_task_group.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_task_group]
    :end-before: [END howto_task_group]

This animated gif shows the UI interactions. TaskGroups are expanded or collapsed when clicked:

.. image:: img/task_group.gif


SLAs
====

Service Level Agreements, or time by which a task or DAG should have
succeeded, can be set at a task level as a ``timedelta``. If
one or many instances have not succeeded by that time, an alert email is sent
detailing the list of tasks that missed their SLA. The event is also recorded
in the database and made available in the web UI under ``Browse->SLA Misses``
where events can be analyzed and documented.

SLAs can be configured for scheduled tasks by using the ``sla`` parameter.
In addition to sending alerts to the addresses specified in a task's ``email`` parameter,
the ``sla_miss_callback`` specifies an additional ``Callable``
object to be invoked when the SLA is not met.

If you don't want to check SLAs, you can disable globally (all the DAGs) by
setting ``check_slas=False`` under ``[core]`` section in ``airflow.cfg`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

  [core]
  check_slas = False

.. note::
    For information on the email configuration, see :doc:`howto/email-config`

.. _concepts/trigger_rule:

Trigger Rules
=============

Though the normal workflow behavior is to trigger tasks when all their
directly upstream tasks have succeeded, Airflow allows for more complex
dependency settings.

All operators have a ``trigger_rule`` argument which defines the rule by which
the generated task get triggered. The default value for ``trigger_rule`` is
``all_success`` and can be defined as "trigger this task when all directly
upstream tasks have succeeded". All other rules described here are based
on direct parent tasks and are values that can be passed to any operator
while creating tasks:

* ``all_success``: (default) all parents have succeeded
* ``all_failed``: all parents are in a ``failed`` or ``upstream_failed`` state
* ``all_done``: all parents are done with their execution
* ``one_failed``: fires as soon as at least one parent has failed, it does not wait for all parents to be done
* ``one_success``: fires as soon as at least one parent succeeds, it does not wait for all parents to be done
* ``none_failed``: all parents have not failed (``failed`` or ``upstream_failed``) i.e. all parents have succeeded or been skipped
* ``none_failed_or_skipped``: all parents have not failed (``failed`` or ``upstream_failed``) and at least one parent has succeeded.
* ``none_skipped``: no parent is in a ``skipped`` state, i.e. all parents are in a ``success``, ``failed``, or ``upstream_failed`` state
* ``dummy``: dependencies are just for show, trigger at will

Note that these can be used in conjunction with ``depends_on_past`` (boolean)
that, when set to ``True``, keeps a task from getting triggered if the
previous schedule for the task hasn't succeeded.

One must be aware of the interaction between trigger rules and skipped tasks
in schedule level. Skipped tasks will cascade through trigger rules
``all_success`` and ``all_failed`` but not ``all_done``, ``one_failed``, ``one_success``,
``none_failed``, ``none_failed_or_skipped``, ``none_skipped`` and ``dummy``.

For example, consider the following DAG:

.. code-block:: python

  #dags/branch_without_trigger.py
  import datetime as dt

  from airflow.models import DAG
  from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
  from airflow.operators.python import BranchPythonOperator

  dag = DAG(
      dag_id='branch_without_trigger',
      schedule_interval='@once',
      start_date=dt.datetime(2019, 2, 28)
  )

  run_this_first = DummyOperator(task_id='run_this_first', dag=dag)
  branching = BranchPythonOperator(
      task_id='branching', dag=dag,
      python_callable=lambda: 'branch_a'
  )

  branch_a = DummyOperator(task_id='branch_a', dag=dag)
  follow_branch_a = DummyOperator(task_id='follow_branch_a', dag=dag)

  branch_false = DummyOperator(task_id='branch_false', dag=dag)

  join = DummyOperator(task_id='join', dag=dag)

  run_this_first >> branching
  branching >> branch_a >> follow_branch_a >> join
  branching >> branch_false >> join

In the case of this DAG, ``join`` is downstream of ``follow_branch_a``
and ``branch_false``. The ``join`` task will show up as skipped
because its ``trigger_rule`` is set to ``all_success`` by default and
skipped tasks will cascade through ``all_success``.

.. image:: img/branch_without_trigger.png

By setting ``trigger_rule`` to ``none_failed_or_skipped`` in ``join`` task,

.. code-block:: python

  #dags/branch_with_trigger.py
  ...
  join = DummyOperator(task_id='join', dag=dag, trigger_rule='none_failed_or_skipped')
  ...

The ``join`` task will be triggered as soon as
``branch_false`` has been skipped (a valid completion state) and
``follow_branch_a`` has succeeded. Because skipped tasks **will not**
cascade through ``none_failed_or_skipped``.

.. image:: img/branch_with_trigger.png

Latest Run Only
===============

Standard workflow behavior involves running a series of tasks for a
particular date/time range. Some workflows, however, perform tasks that
are independent of run time but need to be run on a schedule, much like a
standard cron job. In these cases, backfills or running jobs missed during
a pause just wastes CPU cycles.

For situations like this, you can use the ``LatestOnlyOperator`` to skip
tasks that are not being run during the most recent scheduled run for a
DAG. The ``LatestOnlyOperator`` skips all direct downstream tasks, if the time
right now is not between its ``execution_time`` and the next scheduled
``execution_time`` or the DagRun has been externally triggered.

For example, consider the following DAG:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_latest_only_with_trigger.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START example]
    :end-before: [END example]

In the case of this DAG, the task ``task1`` is directly downstream of
``latest_only`` and will be skipped for all runs except the latest.
``task2`` is entirely independent of ``latest_only`` and will run in all
scheduled periods. ``task3`` is downstream of ``task1`` and ``task2`` and
because of the default ``trigger_rule`` being ``all_success`` will receive
a cascaded skip from ``task1``. ``task4`` is downstream of ``task1`` and
``task2``, but it will not be skipped, since its ``trigger_rule`` is set to
``all_done``.

.. image:: img/latest_only_with_trigger.png


Zombies & Undeads
=================

Task instances die all the time, usually as part of their normal life cycle,
but sometimes unexpectedly.

Zombie tasks are characterized by the absence
of a heartbeat (emitted by the job periodically) and a ``running`` status
in the database. They can occur when a worker node can't reach the database,
when Airflow processes are killed externally, or when a node gets rebooted
for instance. Zombie killing is performed periodically by the scheduler's
process.

Undead processes are characterized by the existence of a process and a matching
heartbeat, but Airflow isn't aware of this task as ``running`` in the database.
This mismatch typically occurs as the state of the database is altered,
most likely by deleting rows in the "Task Instances" view in the UI.
Tasks are instructed to verify their state as part of the heartbeat routine,
and terminate themselves upon figuring out that they are in this "undead"
state.


Cluster Policy
==============

Cluster policies provide an interface for taking action on every Airflow task
or DAG either at DAG load time or just before task execution. In this way users
are able to do the following:

- set default arguments on each DAG/task
- checks that DAG/task meets required standards
- perform custom logic of routing task to a queue

And many other options. To use cluster-wide policies users can define in their
``airflow_local_settings`` the following functions

- ``dag_policy`` - which as an input takes ``dag`` argument of :class:`~airflow.models.dag.DAG` type.
  This function allows users to define dag-level policy which is executed for every DAG at loading time.
- ``task_policy`` - which as an input takes ``task`` argument of :class:`~airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator`
  type. This function allows users to define task-level policy which is executed for every task at DAG loading time.
- ``task_instance_mutation_hook`` - which as an input takes ``task_instance`` argument of
  :class:`~airflow.models.taskinstance.TaskInstance` type. This function allows users to define task-level
  policy that is executed right before the task execution.

In case of DAG and task policies users may raise :class:`~airflow.exceptions.AirflowClusterPolicyViolation`
to prevent a DAG from being imported or prevent a task from being executed if the task is not compliant with
users' check.

Please note, cluster policy will have precedence over task attributes defined in DAG meaning that
if ``task.sla`` is defined in dag and also mutated via cluster policy then the latter will have precedence.

In next sections we show examples of each type of cluster policy.

Where to put ``airflow_local_settings.py``?
-------------------------------------------
Add a ``airflow_local_settings.py`` file to your ``$PYTHONPATH`` or to ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/config`` folder.

See :doc:`modules_management` for details on how Python and Airflow manage modules.


DAG level cluster policy
-----------------------------------
In this example we check if each DAG has at least one tag defined.
Here is what it may look like:

.. literalinclude:: /../../tests/cluster_policies/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [START example_dag_cluster_policy]
      :end-before: [END example_dag_cluster_policy]

Task level cluster policy
-----------------------------
For example, this function could apply a specific queue property when
using a specific operator, or enforce a task timeout policy, making sure
that no tasks run for more than 48 hours. Here's an example of what this
may look like:

.. literalinclude:: /../../tests/cluster_policies/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [START example_task_cluster_policy]
      :end-before: [END example_task_cluster_policy]

As a more advanced example we may consider implementing checks that are intended to help
teams using Airflow to protect against common beginner errors that may get past a code
reviewer, rather than as technical security controls.

For example, don't run tasks without airflow owners:

.. literalinclude:: /../../tests/cluster_policies/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [START example_cluster_policy_rule]
      :end-before: [END example_cluster_policy_rule]

If you have multiple checks to apply, it is best practice to curate these rules
in a separate python module and have a single policy / task mutation hook that
performs multiple of these custom checks and aggregates the various error
messages so that a single ``AirflowClusterPolicyViolation`` can be reported in
the UI (and import errors table in the database).

For Example in ``airflow_local_settings.py``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../tests/cluster_policies/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [START example_list_of_cluster_policy_rules]
      :end-before: [END example_list_of_cluster_policy_rules]

Task instance mutation hook
-------------------------------------------
Task instance mutation hook can be used for example to re-routes the task to
execute in a different queue during retries:

.. literalinclude:: /../../tests/cluster_policies/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [START example_task_mutation_hook]
      :end-before: [END example_task_mutation_hook]

Documentation & Notes
=====================

It's possible to add documentation or notes to your DAGs & task objects that
become visible in the web interface ("Graph View" & "Tree View" for DAGs, "Task Details" for
tasks). There are a set of special task attributes that get rendered as rich
content if defined:

==========  ================
attribute   rendered to
==========  ================
doc         monospace
doc_json    json
doc_yaml    yaml
doc_md      markdown
doc_rst     reStructuredText
==========  ================

Please note that for DAGs, doc_md is the only attribute interpreted.

This is especially useful if your tasks are built dynamically from
configuration files, it allows you to expose the configuration that led
to the related tasks in Airflow.

.. code-block:: python

    """
    ### My great DAG
    """

    dag = DAG('my_dag', default_args=default_args)
    dag.doc_md = __doc__

    t = BashOperator("foo", dag=dag)
    t.doc_md = """\
    #Title"
    Here's a [url](www.airbnb.com)
    """

This content will get rendered as markdown respectively in the "Graph View" and
"Task Details" pages.

.. _jinja-templating:

Jinja Templating
================

Airflow leverages the power of
`Jinja Templating <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`_ and this can be a
powerful tool to use in combination with macros (see the :doc:`macros-ref` section).

For example, say you want to pass the execution date as an environment variable
to a Bash script using the ``BashOperator``.

.. code-block:: python

  # The execution date as YYYY-MM-DD
  date = "{{ ds }}"
  t = BashOperator(
      task_id='test_env',
      bash_command='/tmp/test.sh ',
      dag=dag,
      env={'EXECUTION_DATE': date})

Here, ``{{ ds }}`` is a macro, and because the ``env`` parameter of the
``BashOperator`` is templated with Jinja, the execution date will be available
as an environment variable named ``EXECUTION_DATE`` in your Bash script.

You can use Jinja templating with every parameter that is marked as "templated"
in the documentation. Template substitution occurs just before the pre_execute
function of your operator is called.

You can also use Jinja templating with nested fields, as long as these nested fields
are marked as templated in the structure they belong to: fields registered in
``template_fields`` property will be submitted to template substitution, like the
``path`` field in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

  class MyDataReader:
    template_fields = ['path']

    def __init__(self, my_path):
      self.path = my_path

    # [additional code here...]

  t = PythonOperator(
      task_id='transform_data',
      python_callable=transform_data
      op_args=[
        MyDataReader('/tmp/{{ ds }}/my_file')
      ],
      dag=dag)

.. note:: ``template_fields`` property can equally be a class variable or an
   instance variable.

Deep nested fields can also be substituted, as long as all intermediate fields are
marked as template fields:

.. code-block:: python

  class MyDataTransformer:
    template_fields = ['reader']

    def __init__(self, my_reader):
      self.reader = my_reader

    # [additional code here...]

  class MyDataReader:
    template_fields = ['path']

    def __init__(self, my_path):
      self.path = my_path

    # [additional code here...]

  t = PythonOperator(
      task_id='transform_data',
      python_callable=transform_data
      op_args=[
        MyDataTransformer(MyDataReader('/tmp/{{ ds }}/my_file'))
      ],
      dag=dag)

You can pass custom options to the Jinja ``Environment`` when creating your DAG.
One common usage is to avoid Jinja from dropping a trailing newline from a
template string:

.. code-block:: python

  my_dag = DAG(dag_id='my-dag',
               jinja_environment_kwargs={
                    'keep_trailing_newline': True,
                    # some other jinja2 Environment options here
               })

See `Jinja documentation <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/master/api/#jinja2.Environment>`_
to find all available options.

.. _exceptions:

Exceptions
==========

Airflow defines a number of exceptions; most of these are used internally, but a few
are relevant to authors of custom operators or Python callables called from ``PythonOperator``
tasks. Normally any exception raised from an ``execute`` method or Python callable will either
cause a task instance to fail if it is not configured to retry or has reached its limit on
retry attempts, or to be marked as "up for retry". A few exceptions can be used when different
behavior is desired:

* ``AirflowSkipException`` can be raised to set the state of the current task instance to "skipped"
* ``AirflowFailException`` can be raised to set the state of the current task to "failed" regardless
  of whether there are any retry attempts remaining.

This example illustrates some possibilities

.. code-block:: python

  from airflow.exceptions import AirflowFailException, AirflowSkipException

  def fetch_data():
      try:
          data = get_some_data(get_api_key())
          if not data:
              # Set state to skipped and do not retry
              # Downstream task behavior will be determined by trigger rules
              raise AirflowSkipException("No data available.")
      except Unauthorized:
          # If we retry, our api key will still be bad, so don't waste time retrying!
          # Set state to failed and move on
          raise AirflowFailException("Our api key is bad!")
      except TransientError:
          print("Looks like there was a blip.")
          # Raise the exception and let the task retry unless max attempts were reached
          raise
      handle(data)

  task = PythonOperator(task_id="fetch_data", python_callable=fetch_data, retries=10)

Packaged DAGs
=============

While often you will specify DAGs in a single ``.py`` file it might sometimes
be required to combine a DAG and its dependencies. For example, you might want
to combine several DAGs together to version them together or you might want
to manage them together or you might need an extra module that is not available
by default on the system you are running Airflow on. To allow this you can create
a zip file that contains the DAG(s) in the root of the zip file and have the extra
modules unpacked in directories.

For instance you can create a zip file that looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    my_dag1.py
    my_dag2.py
    package1/__init__.py
    package1/functions.py

Airflow will scan the zip file and try to load ``my_dag1.py`` and ``my_dag2.py``.
It will not go into subdirectories as these are considered to be potential
packages.

In case you would like to add module dependencies to your DAG you basically would
do the same, but then it is more suitable to use a virtualenv and pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv zip_dag
    source zip_dag/bin/activate

    mkdir zip_dag_contents
    cd zip_dag_contents

    pip install --install-option="--install-lib=$PWD" my_useful_package
    cp ~/my_dag.py .

    zip -r zip_dag.zip *

.. note:: the zip file will be inserted at the beginning of module search list
   (sys.path) and as such it will be available to any other code that resides
   within the same interpreter.

.. note:: packaged dags cannot be used with pickling turned on.

.. note:: packaged dags cannot contain dynamic libraries (eg. libz.so) these need
   to be available on the system if a module needs those. In other words only
   pure Python modules can be packaged.


``.airflowignore``
==================

A ``.airflowignore`` file specifies the directories or files in ``DAG_FOLDER``
or ``PLUGINS_FOLDER`` that Airflow should intentionally ignore.
Each line in ``.airflowignore`` specifies a regular expression pattern,
and directories or files whose names (not DAG id) match any of the patterns
would be ignored (under the hood,``Pattern.search()`` is used to match the pattern).
Overall it works like a ``.gitignore`` file.
Use the ``#`` character to indicate a comment; all characters
on a line following a ``#`` will be ignored.

``.airflowignore`` file should be put in your ``DAG_FOLDER``.
For example, you can prepare a ``.airflowignore`` file with contents

.. code-block::

    project_a
    tenant_[\d]


Then files like ``project_a_dag_1.py``, ``TESTING_project_a.py``, ``tenant_1.py``,
``project_a/dag_1.py``, and ``tenant_1/dag_1.py`` in your ``DAG_FOLDER`` would be ignored
(If a directory's name matches any of the patterns, this directory and all its subfolders
would not be scanned by Airflow at all. This improves efficiency of DAG finding).

The scope of a ``.airflowignore`` file is the directory it is in plus all its subfolders.
You can also prepare ``.airflowignore`` file for a subfolder in ``DAG_FOLDER`` and it
would only be applicable for that subfolder.
