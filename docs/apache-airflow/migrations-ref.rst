Reference for Database Migrations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Here's the list of all the Database Migrations that are executed via when you run ``airflow db migrate``.

.. warning::

   Those migration details are mostly used here to make the users aware when and what kind of migrations
   will be executed during migrations between specific Airflow versions. The intention here is that the
   "DB conscious" users might perform an analysis on the migrations and draw conclusions about the impact
   of the migrations on their Airflow database. Those users might also want to take a look at the
   :doc:`database-erd-ref` document to understand how the internal DB of Airflow structure looks like.
   However, you should be aware that the structure is internal and you should not access the DB directly
   to retrieve or modify any data - you should use the :doc:`REST API <stable-rest-api-ref>` to do that instead.
