Listeners
=========

Airflow gives you an option to be notified of events happening in Airflow
by writing listeners. Listeners are powered by `pluggy <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__

Right now Airflow exposes few types of events.

Lifecycle events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Those events - ``on_starting`` and ``before_stopping`` allow you to react to
lifecycle to an Airflow ``Job``, like  ``SchedulerJob`` or ``BackfillJob``.

TaskInstance state change events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Those events - ``on_task_instance_running``, ``on_task_instance_success`` and ``on_task_instance_failed``
once ``TaskInstance`` state changes to one of the respective states. This generally happens on ``LocalTaskJob``.

DagRun state change events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Those events - ``on_dag_run_running``, ``on_dag_run_success`` and ``on_dag_run_failed``
once ``DagRun`` state changes to one of the respective states. This generally happens on ``SchedulerJob`` or ``BackfillJob``.

Usage
=====

To create a listener you will need to derive the import
``airflow.listeners.hookimpl`` and implement the ``hookimpls`` for
events you want to be notified at.

Their specification is defined as ``hookspec`` in ``airflow/listeners/spec`` directory.
Your implementation needs to accept the same named parameters as defined in hookspec, or Pluggy will complain about your plugin.
On the other hand, you don't need to implement every method - it's perfectly fine to have a listener that implements just one method, or any subset of methods.

To include listener in your Airflow installation, include it as a part of an :doc:`Airflow Plugin </plugins>`

Listener API is meant to be called across all dags, and all operators - in contrast to methods like
``on_success_callback``, ``pre_execute`` and related family which are meant to provide callbacks
for particular dag authors, or operator creators. There is no possibility to listen on events generated
by particular dag.
