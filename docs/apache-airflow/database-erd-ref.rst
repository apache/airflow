ERD Schema of the Database
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Here is the current Database schema diagram.

.. warning::

   The ER diagram shows the snapshot of the database structure valid for Airflow version |version| and it
   should be treated as an internal detail. It might be changed at any time and you should not directly
   access the database to retrieve information from it or modify the data - you should use
   :doc:`stable-rest-api-ref` to do that instead.
   The main purpose of this diagram is to help with troubleshooting and understanding of the
   internal Airflow DB architecture in case you have any problems with the database - for example
   when dealing with problems with migrations. See also :doc:`migrations-ref` for
   list of detailed database migrations that are applied when running migration script and
   `db command <cli-and-env-variables-ref.html#db>`_ for the commands that you can use to manage
   the migrations.
