Access Control
==============

Access Control of Airflow Webserver UI is handled by Flask AppBuilder (FAB).
Please read its related `security document <http://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html>`_
regarding its security model.

Default Roles
'''''''''''''
Airflow ships with a set of roles by default: Admin, User, Op, Viewer, and Public.
By default, only ``Admin`` users can configure/alter permissions for roles. However,
it is recommended that these default roles remain unaltered, and instead ``Admin`` users
create new roles with the desired permissions if changes are necessary.

Public
^^^^^^
``Public`` users (anonymous) don't have any permissions.

Viewer
^^^^^^
``Viewer`` users have limited read permissions:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/security_manager/override.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_viewer_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_viewer_perms]

User
^^^^
``User`` users have ``Viewer`` permissions plus additional permissions:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/security_manager/override.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_user_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_user_perms]

Op
^^
``Op`` users have ``User`` permissions plus additional permissions:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/security_manager/override.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_op_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_op_perms]

Admin
^^^^^
``Admin`` users have all possible permissions, including granting or revoking permissions from
other users. ``Admin`` users have ``Op`` permission plus additional permissions:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/security_manager/override.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_admin_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_admin_perms]

Custom Roles
'''''''''''''

DAG Level Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``Admin`` can create a set of roles which are only allowed to view a certain set of DAGs. This is called DAG level access. Each DAG defined in the DAG model table
is treated as a ``View`` which has two permissions associated with it (``can_read`` and ``can_edit``. ``can_dag_read`` and ``can_dag_edit`` are deprecated since 2.0.0).
There is a special view called ``DAGs`` (it was called ``all_dags`` in versions 1.10.*) which
allows the role to access all the DAGs. The default ``Admin``, ``Viewer``, ``User``, ``Op`` roles can all access ``DAGs`` view.

.. image:: /img/add-role.png
.. image:: /img/new-role.png

The image shows the creation of a role which can only write to
``example_python_operator``. You can also create roles via the CLI
using the ``airflow roles create`` command, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

  airflow roles create Role1 Role2

And we could assign the given role to a new user using the ``airflow
users add-role`` CLI command.


Permissions
'''''''''''

Resource-Based permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with version 2.0, permissions are based on individual resources and a small subset of actions on those
resources. Resources match standard Airflow concepts, such as ``Dag``, ``DagRun``, ``Task``, and
``Connection``. Actions include ``can_create``, ``can_read``, ``can_edit``, and ``can_delete``.

Permissions (each consistent of a resource + action pair) are then added to roles.

**To access an endpoint, the user needs all permissions assigned to that endpoint**

There are five default roles: Public, Viewer, User, Op, and Admin. Each one has the permissions of the preceding role, as well as additional permissions.

DAG-level permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For DAG-level permissions exclusively, access can be controlled at the level of all DAGs or individual DAG objects. This includes ``DAGs.can_read``, ``DAGs.can_edit``, and ``DAGs.can_delete``. When these permissions are listed, access is granted to users who either have the listed permission or the same permission for the specific DAG being acted upon. For individual DAGs, the resource name is ``DAG:`` + the DAG ID.

For example, if a user is trying to view DAG information for the ``example_dag_id``, and the endpoint requires ``DAGs.can_read`` access, access will be granted if the user has either ``DAGs.can_read`` or ``DAG:example_dag_id.can_read`` access.

These DAG-level controls can be set directly through the UI / CLI, or encoded in the dags themselves through the access_control arg.

Order of precedence for DAG-level permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since DAG-level access control can be configured in multiple places, conflicts are inevitable and a clear resolution strategy is required. As a result,
Airflow considers the ``access_control`` argument supplied on a DAG itself to be completely authoritative if present, which has a few effects:

Setting ``access_control`` on a DAG will overwrite any previously existing DAG-level permissions if it is any value other than ``None``:

.. code-block:: python

    DAG(
        dag_id="example_fine_grained_access",
        start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
        access_control={
            "Viewer": {"can_edit", "can_read", "can_delete"},
        },
    )

This also means that setting ``access_control={}`` will wipe any existing DAG-level permissions for a given DAG from the DB:

.. code-block:: python

    DAG(
        dag_id="example_no_fine_grained_access",
        start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
        access_control={},
    )

Conversely, removing the access_control block from a DAG altogether (or setting it to ``None``) won't make any changes and can leave dangling permissions.

.. code-block:: python

    DAG(
        dag_id="example_indifferent_to_fine_grained_access",
        start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz="UTC"),
    )

In the case that there is no ``access_control`` defined on the DAG itself, Airflow will defer to existing permissions defined in the DB, which
may have been set through the UI, CLI or by previous access_control args on the DAG in question.

In all cases, system-wide roles such as ``Can edit on DAG`` take precedence over dag-level access controls, such that they can be considered ``Can edit on DAG: *``
