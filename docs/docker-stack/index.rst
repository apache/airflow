    build-arg-ref

For the ease of deployment in production, the community releases a production-ready reference container
image.

The docker image provided (as convenience binary package) in the
`apache/airflow DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow>`_ is a bare image
that has a few external dependencies and extras installed..

The Apache Airflow image provided as convenience package is optimized for size, so
it provides just a bare minimal set of the extras and dependencies installed and in most cases
you want to either extend or customize the image. You can see all possible extras in
:doc:`extra-packages-ref`. The set of extras used in Airflow Production image are available in the
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2c6c7fdb2308de98e142618836bdf414df9768c8/Dockerfile#L39>`_.

The production images are build in DockerHub from released version and release candidates. There
are also images published from branches but they are used mainly for development and testing purpose.
See `Airflow Git Branching <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#airflow-git-branches>`_
for details.


Usage
=====

The :envvar:`AIRFLOW_HOME` is set by default to ``/opt/airflow/`` - this means that DAGs
are in default in the ``/opt/airflow/dags`` folder and logs are in the ``/opt/airflow/logs``

The working directory is ``/opt/airflow`` by default.

If no :envvar:`AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN` variable is set then SQLite database is created in
``${AIRFLOW_HOME}/airflow.db``.

For example commands that start Airflow see: :ref:`entrypoint:commands`.

Airflow requires many components to function as it is a distributed application. You may therefore also be interested
in launching Airflow in the Docker Compose environment, see: :doc:`apache-airflow:start/index`.

You can use this image in :doc:`Helm Chart <helm-chart:index>` as well.
