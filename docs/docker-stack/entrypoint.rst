Entrypoint
==========

If you are using the default entrypoint of the production image,
there are a few actions that are automatically performed when the container starts.
In some cases, you can pass environment variables to the image to trigger some of that behaviour.

The variables that control the "execution" behaviour start with ``_AIRFLOW`` to distinguish them
from the variables used to build the image starting with ``AIRFLOW``.

The image entrypoint works as follows:

* In case the user is not "airflow" (with undefined user id) and the group id of the user is set to ``0`` (root),
  then the user is dynamically added to ``/etc/passwd`` at entry using ``USER_NAME`` variable to define the user name.
  This is in order to accommodate the
  `OpenShift Guidelines <https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/creating_images/guidelines.html>`_

* The ``AIRFLOW_HOME`` is set by default to ``/opt/airflow/`` - this means that DAGs
  are in default in the ``/opt/airflow/dags`` folder and logs are in the ``/opt/airflow/logs``

* The working directory is ``/opt/airflow`` by default.

* If ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable is passed to the container and it is either mysql or postgres
  SQL alchemy connection, then the connection is checked and the script waits until the database is reachable.
  If ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_CMD`` variable is passed to the container, it is evaluated as a
  command to execute and result of this evaluation is used as ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN``. The
  ``_CMD`` variable takes precedence over the ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable.

* If no ``AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` variable is set then SQLite database is created in
  ``${AIRFLOW_HOME}/airflow.db`` and db reset is executed.

* If first argument equals to "bash" - you are dropped to a bash shell or you can executes bash command
  if you specify extra arguments. For example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 bash -c "ls -la"
    total 16
    drwxr-xr-x 4 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 .
    drwxr-xr-x 1 root    root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 ..
    drwxr-xr-x 2 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 dags
    drwxr-xr-x 2 airflow root 4096 Jun  5 18:12 logs

* If first argument is equal to ``python`` - you are dropped in python shell or python commands are executed if
  you pass extra parameters. For example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    > docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 python -c "print('test')"
    test

* If first argument equals to "airflow" - the rest of the arguments is treated as an airflow command
  to execute. Example:

  .. code-block:: bash

     docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 airflow webserver

* If there are any other arguments - they are simply passed to the "airflow" command

  .. code-block:: bash

    > docker run -it apache/airflow:master-python3.6 version
    2.1.0.dev0

* If ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`` variable is passed and airflow command with
  scheduler, worker of flower command is used, then the script checks the broker connection
  and waits until the Celery broker database is reachable.
  If ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL_CMD`` variable is passed to the container, it is evaluated as a
  command to execute and result of this evaluation is used as ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL``. The
  ``_CMD`` variable takes precedence over the ``AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`` variable.

.. _arbitrary-docker-user:

Allowing arbitrary user to run the container
--------------------------------------------

Airflow image is Open-Shift compatible, which means that you can start it with random user ID and the
group id ``0`` (``root``). If you want to run the image with user different than Airflow, you MUST set
GID of the user to ``0``. In case you try to use different group, the entrypoint exits with error.

In order to accommodate a number of external libraries and projects, Airflow will automatically create
such an arbitrary user in (`/etc/passwd`) and make it's home directory point to ``/home/airflow``.
Many of 3rd-party libraries and packages require home directory of the user to be present, because they
need to write some cache information there, so such a dynamic creation of a user is necessary.

Such arbitrary user has to be able to write to certain directories that needs write access, and since
it is not advised to allow write access to "other" for security reasons, the OpenShift
guidelines introduced the concept of making all such folders have the ``0`` (``root``) group id (GID).
All the directories that need write access in the Airflow production image have GID set to 0 (and
they are writable for the group). We are following that concept and all the directories that need
write access follow that.

The GID=0 is set as default for the ``airflow`` user, so any directories it creates have GID set to 0
by default. The entrypoint sets ``umask`` to be ``0002`` - this means that any directories created by
the user have also "group write" access for group ``0`` - they will be writable by other users with
``root`` group. Also whenever any "arbitrary" user creates a folder (for example in a mounted volume), that
folder will have a "group write" access and ``GID=0``, so that execution with another, arbitrary user
will still continue to work, even if such directory is mounted by another arbitrary user later.

The ``umask`` setting however only works for runtime of the container - it is not used during building of
the image. If you would like to extend the image and add your own packages, you should remember to add
``umask 0002`` in front of your docker command - this way the directories created by any installation
that need group access will also be writable for the group. This can be done for example this way:

  .. code-block:: docker

      RUN umask 0002; \
          do_something; \
          do_otherthing;


You can read more about it in the "Support arbitrary user ids" chapter in the
`Openshift best practices <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images>`_.


Waits for Airflow DB connection
-------------------------------

In case Postgres or MySQL DB is used, the entrypoint will wait until the airflow DB connection becomes
available. This happens always when you use the default entrypoint.

The script detects backend type depending on the URL schema and assigns default port numbers if not specified
in the URL. Then it loops until the connection to the host/port specified can be established
It tries ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT`` times and sleeps ``CONNECTION_CHECK_SLEEP_TIME`` between checks
To disable check, set ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT=0``.

Supported schemes:

* ``postgres://`` - default port 5432
* ``mysql://``    - default port 3306
* ``sqlite://``

In case of SQLite backend, there is no connection to establish and waiting is skipped.

Upgrading Airflow DB
--------------------

If you set ``_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE`` variable to a non-empty value, the entrypoint will run
the ``airflow db upgrade`` command right after verifying the connection. You can also use this
when you are running airflow with internal SQLite database (default) to upgrade the db and create
admin users at entrypoint, so that you can start the webserver immediately. Note - using SQLite is
intended only for testing purpose, never use SQLite in production as it has severe limitations when it
comes to concurrency.

Creating admin user
-------------------

The entrypoint can also create webserver user automatically when you enter it. you need to set
``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE`` to a non-empty value in order to do that. This is not intended for
production, it is only useful if you would like to run a quick test with the production image.
You need to pass at least password to create such user via ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD`` or
``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD`` similarly like for other ``*_CMD`` variables, the content of
the ``*_CMD`` will be evaluated as shell command and it's output will be set as password.

User creation will fail if none of the ``PASSWORD`` variables are set - there is no default for
password for security reasons.

+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter | Default                  | Environment variable                                                 |
+===========+==========================+======================================================================+
| username  | admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_USERNAME``                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| password  |                          | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD`` or ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD`` |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| firstname | Airflow                  | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_FIRSTNAME``                                      |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| lastname  | Admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_LASTNAME``                                       |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| email     | airflowadmin@example.com | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_EMAIL``                                          |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| role      | Admin                    | ``_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_ROLE``                                           |
+-----------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In case the password is specified, the user will be attempted to be created, but the entrypoint will
not fail if the attempt fails (this accounts for the case that the user is already created).

You can, for example start the webserver in the production image with initializing the internal SQLite
database and creating an ``admin/admin`` Admin user with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD=admin" \
      apache/airflow:master-python3.8 webserver


.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_DB_UPGRADE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_CREATE=true" \
    --env "_AIRFLOW_WWW_USER_PASSWORD_CMD=echo admin" \
      apache/airflow:master-python3.8 webserver

The commands above perform initialization of the SQLite database, create admin user with admin password
and Admin role. They also forward local port ``8080`` to the webserver port and finally start the webserver.

Waits for celery broker connection
----------------------------------

In case Postgres or MySQL DB is used, and one of the ``scheduler``, ``celery``, ``worker``, or ``flower``
commands are used the entrypoint will wait until the celery broker DB connection is available.

The script detects backend type depending on the URL schema and assigns default port numbers if not specified
in the URL. Then it loops until connection to the host/port specified can be established
It tries ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT`` times and sleeps ``CONNECTION_CHECK_SLEEP_TIME`` between checks.
To disable check, set ``CONNECTION_CHECK_MAX_COUNT=0``.

Supported schemes:

* ``amqp(s)://``  (rabbitmq) - default port 5672
* ``redis://``               - default port 6379
* ``postgres://``            - default port 5432
* ``mysql://``               - default port 3306
* ``sqlite://``

In case of SQLite backend, there is no connection to establish and waiting is skipped.
