Task Docker Decorator
=====================

Python callable wrapped within the ``@task.docker`` decorator with args are executed within
the docker container.

Parameters
----------

The following parameters are supported in Docker Task decorator.

multiple_outputs
    If set, function return value will be unrolled to multiple XCom values.
    Dict will unroll to XCom values with keys as XCom keys. Defaults to False.
use_dill
    Whether to use dill or pickle for serialization
python_command
    Python command for executing functions, Default python3
image
    Docker image from which to create the container.
    If image tag is omitted, "latest" will be used.
api_version
    Remote API version. Set to ``auto`` to automatically detect the server's version.
container_name
    Name of the container. Optional (templated)
cpus
    Number of CPUs to assign to the container. This value gets multiplied with 1024.
docker_url
    URL of the host running the docker daemon.
    Default is unix://var/run/docker.sock
environment
    Environment variables to set in the container. (templated)
private_environment
    Private environment variables to set in the container.
    These are not templated, and hidden from the website.
env_file
    Relative path to the ``.env`` file with environment variables to set in the container.
    Overridden by variables in the environment parameter.
force_pull
    Pull the docker image on every run. Default is False.
mem_limit
    Maximum amount of memory the container can use.
    Either a float value, which represents the limit in bytes,
    or a string like ``128m`` or ``1g``.
host_tmp_dir
    Specify the location of the temporary directory on the host which will
    be mapped to tmp_dir. If not provided defaults to using the standard system temp directory.
network_mode
    Network mode for the container. It can be one of the following

    - ``"bridge"``: Create new network stack for the container with default docker bridge network
    - ``"none"``: No networking for this container
    - ``"container:<name>"`` or ``"container:<id>"``: Use the network stack of another container specified via <name> or <id>
    - ``"host"``: Use the host network stack. Incompatible with **port_bindings**
    - ``"<network-name>"`` or ``"<network-id>"``: Connects the container to user created network (using ``docker network create`` command)
tls_ca_cert
    Path to a PEM-encoded certificate authority to secure the docker connection.
tls_client_cert
    Path to the PEM-encoded certificate used to authenticate docker client.
tls_client_key
    Path to the PEM-encoded key used to authenticate docker client.
tls_verify
    Set ``True`` to verify the validity of the provided certificate.
tls_hostname
    Hostname to match against the docker server certificate or False to disable the check.
tls_ssl_version
    Version of SSL to use when communicating with docker daemon.
mount_tmp_dir
    Specify whether the temporary directory should be bind-mounted from the host to the container.
tmp_dir
    Mount point inside the container to
    a temporary directory created on the host by the operator.
    The path is also made available via the environment variable
    ``AIRFLOW_TMP_DIR`` inside the container.
user
    Default user inside the docker container.
mounts
    List of mounts to mount into the container, e.g.
    ``['/host/path:/container/path', '/host/path2:/container/path2:ro']``.
working_dir
    Working directory to set on the container (equivalent to the -w switch the docker client)
entrypoint
    Overwrite the default ENTRYPOINT of the image
xcom_all
    Push all the stdout or just the last line. The default is False (last line).
docker_conn_id
    ID of the Airflow connection to use
dns
    Docker custom DNS servers
dns_search
    Docker custom DNS search domain
auto_remove
    Enable removal of the container when the container's process exits. Possible values

    - ``never``: (default) do not remove container
    - ``success``: remove on success
    - ``force``: always remove container
shm_size
    Size of ``/dev/shm`` in bytes. The size must be greater than 0.
    If omitted uses system default.
tty
    Allocate pseudo-TTY to the container
    This needs to be set see logs of the Docker container.
hostname
    Optional hostname for the container.
privileged
    Give extended privileges to this container.
cap_add
    Include container capabilities
extra_hosts
    Additional hostnames to resolve inside the container, as a mapping of hostname to IP address.
retrieve_output
    Should this docker image consistently attempt to pull from and output
    file before manually shutting down the image. Useful for cases where users want a pickle serialized
    output that is not posted to logs
retrieve_output_path
    path for output file that will be retrieved and passed to xcom
timeout
    Default timeout for API calls, in seconds.
device_requests
    Expose host resources such as GPUs to the container.
log_opts_max_size
    The maximum size of the log before it is rolled.
    A positive integer plus a modifier representing the unit of measure (k, m, or g).
    Eg: 10m or 1g Defaults to -1 (unlimited).
log_opts_max_file
    The maximum number of log files that can be present.
    If rolling the logs creates excess files, the oldest file is removed.
    Only effective when max-size is also set. A positive integer. Defaults to 1.
ipc_mode
    Set the IPC mode for the container.
skip_on_exit_code
    If task exits with this exit code, leave the task
    in ``skipped`` state (default: None). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
    exit code will be treated as a failure.
port_bindings
    Publish a container's port(s) to the host. It is a
    dictionary of value where the key indicates the port to open inside the container
    and value indicates the host port that binds to the container port.
    Incompatible with ``"host"`` in ``network_mode``.
ulimits
    List of ulimit options to set for the container.
    Each item should be a ``docker.types.Ulimit`` instance.
