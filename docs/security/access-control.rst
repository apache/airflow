Default Roles
'''''''''''''
Airflow ships with a set of roles by default: Admin, User, Op, Viewer, and Public.
Only ``Admin`` users could configure/alter the permissions for other roles. But it is not recommended
that ``Admin`` users alter these default roles in any way by removing
or adding permissions to these roles.

Admin
^^^^^
``Admin`` users have all possible permissions, including granting or revoking permissions from
other users.

Public
^^^^^^
``Public`` users (anonymous) don't have any permissions.

Viewer
^^^^^^
``Viewer`` users have limited viewer permissions

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/www/security.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_viewer_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_viewer_perms]

on limited web views

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/www/security.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_viewer_vms]
    :end-before: [END security_viewer_vms]


User
^^^^
``User`` users have ``Viewer`` permissions plus additional user permissions

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/www/security.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_user_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_user_perms]

on User web views which is the same as Viewer web views.

Op
^^
``Op`` users have ``User`` permissions plus additional op permissions

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/www/security.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_op_perms]
    :end-before: [END security_op_perms]

on ``User`` web views plus these additional op web views

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/www/security.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START security_op_vms]
    :end-before: [END security_op_vms]


Custom Roles
'''''''''''''

DAG Level Role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``Admin`` can create a set of roles which are only allowed to view a certain set of dags. This is called DAG level access. Each dag defined in the dag model table
is treated as a ``View`` which has two permissions associated with it (``can_dag_read`` and ``can_dag_edit``). There is a special view called ``all_dags`` which
allows the role to access all the dags. The default ``Admin``, ``Viewer``, ``User``, ``Op`` roles can all access ``all_dags`` view.
