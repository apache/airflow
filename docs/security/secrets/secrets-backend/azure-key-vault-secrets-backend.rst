Azure Key Vault Backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable the Azure Key Vault as secrets backend, specify
:py:class:`~airflow.providers.microsoft.azure.secrets.azure_key_vault.AzureKeyVaultBackend`
as the ``backend`` in  ``[secrets]`` section of ``airflow.cfg``.

Here is a sample configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.microsoft.azure.secrets.azure_key_vault.AzureKeyVaultBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow-connections", "variables_prefix": "airflow-variables", "vault_url": "https://example-akv-resource-name.vault.azure.net/"}

For client authentication, the ``DefaultAzureCredential`` from the Azure Python SDK is used as credential provider,
which supports service principal, managed identity and user credentials.

Optional lookup
"""""""""""""""

Optionally connections, variables, or config may be looked up exclusive of each other or in any combination.
This will prevent requests being sent to Azure Key Vault for the excluded type.

If you want to look up some and not others in Azure Key Vault you may do so by setting the relevant ``*_prefix`` parameter of the ones to be excluded as ``null``.

For example, if you want to set parameter ``connections_prefix`` to ``"airflow-connections"`` and not look up variables, your configuration file should look like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.microsoft.azure.secrets.azure_key_vault.AzureKeyVaultBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow-connections", "variables_prefix": null, "vault_url": "https://example-akv-resource-name.vault.azure.net/"}

Storing and Retrieving Connections
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you have set ``connections_prefix`` as ``airflow-connections``, then for a connection id of ``smtp_default``,
you would want to store your connection at ``airflow-connections-smtp-default``.

The value of the secret must be the :ref:`connection URI representation <generating_connection_uri>`
of the connection object.

Storing and Retrieving Variables
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you have set ``variables_prefix`` as ``airflow-variables``, then for an Variable key of ``hello``,
you would want to store your Variable at ``airflow-variables-hello``.
