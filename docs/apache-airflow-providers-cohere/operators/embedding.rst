CohereEmbeddingOperator
========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.cohere.operators.embedding.CohereEmbeddingOperator` to
interact with Cohere APIs to create embeddings for a given text.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CohereEmbeddingOperator requires the ``input_text`` as an input to embedding API. Use the ``conn_id`` parameter to specify the Cohere connection to use to
connect to your account.
