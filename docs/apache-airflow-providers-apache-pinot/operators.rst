Apache Pinot Hooks
==================


`Apache Pinot <https://pinot.apache.org/>`__ is a column-oriented, open-source, distributed data store written in Java. Pinot is designed to execute OLAP queries with low latency. It is suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion.


Prerequisite
------------

.. To use Pinot hooks, you must configure :doc:`Pinot Connection <connections/pinot>`.

.. _howto/operator:PinotHooks:

PinotAdminHook
--------------

This hook is a wrapper around the pinot-admin.sh script, which is used for administering a Pinot cluster and provided by Apache Pinot distribution. For now, only small subset of its subcommands are implemented, which are required to ingest offline data into Apache Pinot (i.e., AddSchema, AddTable, CreateSegment, and UploadSegment). Their command options are based on Pinot v0.1.0.

Parameters
----------

For parameter definition, take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.pinot.hooks.pinot.PinotAdminHook`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/apache/pinot/example_pinot_dag.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_pinot_admin_hook]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_pinot_admin_hook]

Reference
^^^^^^^^^

For more information, please see the documentation at ``Apache Pinot improvements for PinotAdminHook<https://pinot.apache.org/>``

PinotDbApiHook
--------------

This hook uses standard-SQL endpoint since PQL endpoint is soon to be deprecated.

Parameters
----------

For parameter definition, take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.pinot.hooks.pinot.PinotDbApiHook`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/apache/pinot/example_pinot_dag.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_pinot_dbapi_example]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_pinot_dbapi_example]
