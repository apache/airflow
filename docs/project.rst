History

Airflow was started in October 2014 by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb.
It was open source from the very first commit and officially brought under
the Airbnb GitHub and announced in June 2015.

The project joined the Apache Software Foundation's Incubator program in March 2016 and the
Foundation `announced Apache Airflow as a Top-Level Project
<https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces44>`_
