Variable                            Description
=================================   ====================================
``@namespace``                      The namespace is your isolated work environment within kubernetes
``@image``                          docker image you wish to launch. Defaults to dockerhub.io, but fully qualified URLS will point to custom repositories
 ``@cmds``                           To start a task in a docker image, we need to tell it what to do. the cmds array is the space seperated bash command that will define the task completed by the container
``arguments``                       arguments for your bash command
``@labels``                         Labels are an important element of launching kubernetes pods, as it tells kubernetes what pods a service can route to. For example, if you launch 5 postgres pods with the label  {'postgres':'foo'} and create a postgres service with the same label, kubernetes will know that any time that service is queried, it can pick any of those 5 postgres instances as the endpoint for that service.
``@name``                           name of the task you want to run, will be used to generate a pod id
