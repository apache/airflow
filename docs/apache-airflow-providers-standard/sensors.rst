.. _howto/operator:TimeDeltaSensor:

TimeDeltaSensor
===============

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.standard.sensors.time_delta.TimeDeltaSensor` to end sensing after specific time.


.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_sensors.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START example_time_delta_sensor]
    :end-before: [END example_time_delta_sensor]


.. _howto/operator:TimeDeltaSensorAsync:

TimeDeltaSensorAsync
====================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.standard.sensors.time_delta.TimeDeltaSensorAsync` to end sensing after specific time.
It is an async version of the operator and requires Triggerer to run.


.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_sensors.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START example_time_delta_sensor_async]
    :end-before: [END example_time_delta_sensor_async]



.. _howto/operator:TimeSensor:

TimeSensor
==========

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.standard.sensors.time_sensor.TimeSensor` to end sensing after time specified.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_sensors.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START example_time_sensors]
    :end-before: [END example_time_sensors]

.. _howto/operator:BranchDayOfWeekOperator:

BranchDayOfWeekOperator
=======================

Use the :class:`~airflow.operators.weekday.BranchDayOfWeekOperator` to branch your workflow based on week day value.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_branch_day_of_week_operator.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_day_of_week_branch]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_day_of_week_branch]

.. _howto/operator:DayOfWeekSensor:

DayOfWeekSensor
===============

Use the :class:`~airflow.sensors.weekday.DayOfWeekSensor` to sense for day of week.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/example_dags/example_sensors.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START example_day_of_week_sensor]
    :end-before: [END example_day_of_week_sensor]
