.. _howto/operator:PythonSensor:

PythonSensor
============

The :class:`~airflow.providers.standard.sensors.python.PythonSensor` executes an arbitrary callable and waits for its return
value to be True.

.. tip::
    The ``@task.sensor`` decorator is recommended over the classic ``PythonSensor``
    to execute Python callables to check for True condition.
