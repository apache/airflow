Using the Command Line Interface
================================

This document is meant to give an overview of all common tasks while using the CLI.


Set Up connection to a remote Airflow instance
----------------------------------------------

For some functions the CLI can use :doc:`the REST API <rest-api-ref>`. To configure the CLI to use the API
when available configure as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

    [cli]
    api_client = airflow.api.client.json_client
    endpoint_url = http://<WEBSERVER>:<PORT>


Set Up Bash/Zsh Completion
--------------------------

When using bash (or ``zsh``) as your shell, ``airflow`` can use
`argcomplete <https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/>`_ for auto-completion.

For `global activation <https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete#activating-global-completion>`_ of all argcomplete enabled python applications run:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete

For permanent (but not global) airflow activation, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  register-python-argcomplete airflow >> ~/.bashrc

For one-time activation of argcomplete for airflow only, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete airflow)"

.. image:: img/cli_completion.gif

If youâ€™re using ``zsh``, add the following to your ``.zshrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

  autoload bashcompinit
  bashcompinit
  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete airflow)"
