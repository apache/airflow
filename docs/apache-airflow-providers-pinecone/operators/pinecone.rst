Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:PineconeIngestOperator:

Ingest data into a pinecone index
=================================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.pinecone.operators.pinecone.PineconeIngestOperator` to
interact with Pinecone APIs to ingest vectors.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PineconeIngestOperator requires the ``vectors`` as an input ingest into Pinecone. Use the ``conn_id`` parameter to
specify the Pinecone connection to use to connect to your account. The vectors could also contain metadata referencing
the original text corresponding to the vectors that could be ingested into the database.

An example using the operator in this way:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/pinecone/example_dag_pinecone.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_pinecone_ingest]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_pinecone_ingest]

.. _howto/operator:CreatePodIndexOperator:

Create a Pod based Index
========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.pinecone.operators.pinecone.CreatePodIndexOperator` to
interact with Pinecone APIs to create a Pod based Index.

Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``CreatePodIndexOperator`` requires the index details as well as the pod configuration details. ``api_key``, ``environment`` can be
passed via arguments to the operator or via the connection.

An example using the operator in this way:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/pinecone/example_create_pod_index.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_create_pod_index]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_create_pod_index]


.. _howto/operator:CreateServerlessIndexOperator:

Create a Serverless Index
=========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.pinecone.operators.pinecone.CreateServerlessIndexOperator` to
interact with Pinecone APIs to create a Pod based Index.

Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``CreateServerlessIndexOperator``  requires the index details as well as the Serverless configuration details. ``api_key``, ``environment`` can be
passed via arguments to the operator or via the connection.

An example using the operator in this way:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/pinecone/example_create_serverless_index.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_create_serverless_index]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_create_serverless_index]
