SalesforceApexRestOperator
==========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.salesforce.operators.salesforce_apex_rest.SalesforceApexRestOperator` to execute Apex Rest.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can also use this library to call custom Apex methods:

This would call the endpoint ``https://<instance>.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/User/Activity`` with ``payload`` as
the body content encoded with ``json.dumps``
