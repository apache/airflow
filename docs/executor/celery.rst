.. _executor:CeleryExecutor:

Celery Executor
===============

``CeleryExecutor`` is one of the ways you can scale out the number of workers. For this
to work, you need to setup a Celery backend (**RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, ...) and
change your ``airflow.cfg`` to point the executor parameter to
``CeleryExecutor`` and provide the related Celery settings.

For more information about setting up a Celery broker, refer to the
exhaustive `Celery documentation on the topic <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/index.html>`_.

Here are a few imperative requirements for your workers:

- ``airflow`` needs to be installed, and the CLI needs to be in the path
- Airflow configuration settings should be homogeneous across the cluster
- Operators that are executed on the worker need to have their dependencies
  met in that context. For example, if you use the ``HiveOperator``,
  the hive CLI needs to be installed on that box, or if you use the
  ``MySqlOperator``, the required Python library needs to be available in
  the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` somehow
- The worker needs to have access to its ``DAGS_FOLDER``, and you need to
  synchronize the filesystems by your own means. A common setup would be to
  store your ``DAGS_FOLDER`` in a Git repository and sync it across machines using
  Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or whatever you use to configure machines in your
  environment. If all your boxes have a common mount point, having your
  pipelines files shared there should work as well


To kick off a worker, you need to setup Airflow and kick off the worker
subcommand

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow celery worker

Your worker should start picking up tasks as soon as they get fired in
its direction. To stop a worker running on a machine you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow celery stop

It will try to stop the worker gracefully by sending ``SIGTERM`` signal to main Celery
process as recommended by
`Celery documentation <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers>`__.

Note that you can also run `Celery Flower <https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
a web UI built on top of Celery, to monitor your workers. You can use the shortcut command
to start a Flower web server:

.. code-block:: bash

    airflow celery stop

Please note that you must have the ``flower`` python library already installed on your system. The recommend way is to install the airflow celery bundle.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install 'apache-airflow[celery]'


Some caveats:

- Make sure to use a database backed result backend
- Make sure to set a visibility timeout in ``[celery_broker_transport_options]`` that exceeds the ETA of your longest running task
- Make sure to set umask in ``[worker_umask]`` to set permissions for newly created files by workers.
- Tasks can consume resources. Make sure your worker has enough resources to run ``worker_concurrency`` tasks
- Queue names are limited to 256 characters, but each broker backend might have its own restrictions

Architecture
------------

.. graphviz::

    digraph A{
        rankdir="TB"
        node[shape="rectangle", style="rounded"]


        subgraph cluster {
            label="Cluster";
            {rank = same; dag; database}
            {rank = same; workers; scheduler; web}

            workers[label="Workers"]
            scheduler[label="Scheduler"]
            web[label="Web server"]
            database[label="Database"]
            dag[label="DAG files"]

            subgraph cluster_queue {
                label="Celery";
                {rank = same; queue_broker; queue_result_backend}
                queue_broker[label="Queue broker"]
                queue_result_backend[label="Result backend"]
            }

            web->workers[label="1"]
            web->dag[label="2"]
            web->database[label="3"]

            workers->dag[label="4"]
            workers->database[label="5"]
            workers->queue_result_backend[label="6"]
            workers->queue_broker[label="7"]

            scheduler->dag[label="8"]
            scheduler->database[label="9"]
            scheduler->queue_result_backend[label="10"]
            scheduler->queue_broker[label="11"]
        }
    }

Airflow consist of several components:

* **Workers** - Execute the assigned tasks
* **Scheduler** - Responsible for adding the necessary tasks to the queue
* **Web server** - HTTP Server provides access to DAG/task status information
* **Database** - Contains information about the status of tasks, DAGs, Variables, connections, etc.
* **Celery** - Queue mechanism

Please note that the queue at Celery consists of two components:

* **Broker** - Stores commands for execution
* **Result backend** - Stores status of completed commands

The components communicate with each other in many places

* [1] **Web server** --> **Workers** - Fetches task execution logs
* [2] **Web server** --> **DAG files** - Reveal the DAG structure
* [3] **Web server** --> **Database** - Fetch the status of the tasks
* [4] **Workers** --> **DAG files** - Reveal the DAG structure and execute the tasks
* [5] **Workers** --> **Database** - Gets and stores information about connection configuration, variables and XCOM.
* [6] **Workers** --> **Celery's result backend** - Saves the status of tasks
* [7] **Workers** --> **Celery's broker** - Stores commands for execution
* [8] **Scheduler** --> **DAG files** - Reveal the DAG structure and execute the tasks
* [9] **Scheduler** --> **Database** - Store a DAG run and related tasks
* [10] **Scheduler** --> **Celery's result backend** - Gets information about the status of completed tasks
* [11] **Scheduler** --> **Celery's broker** - Put the commands to be executed
