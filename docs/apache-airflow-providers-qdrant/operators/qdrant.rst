QdrantIngestOperator
======================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.qdrant.operators.qdrant.QdrantIngestOperator` to
ingest data into a Qdrant instance.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The QdrantIngestOperator requires the ``vectors`` as an input ingest into Qdrant. Use the ``conn_id`` parameter to
specify the Qdrant connection to connect to Qdrant instance. The vectors could also contain metadata referencing
the original text corresponding to the vectors that could be ingested into the database.

An example using the operator in this way:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/qdrant/example_dag_qdrant.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_qdrant_ingest]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_qdrant_ingest]
