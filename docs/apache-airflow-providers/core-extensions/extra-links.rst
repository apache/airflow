Extra Links
-----------

This is a summary of all Apache Airflow Community provided implementations of operator extra links
exposed via community-managed providers.

Airflow can be extended by providers with custom operator extra links. For each operator, you can define
its own extra links that can redirect users to external systems. The extra link buttons
will be available on the task page.

The operator extra links are explained in
:doc:`apache-airflow:howto/define_extra_link` and here you can also see the extra links
provided by the community-managed providers:
