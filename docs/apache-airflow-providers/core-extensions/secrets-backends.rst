Secret backends
---------------

This is a summary of all Apache Airflow Community provided implementations of secret backends
exposed via community-managed providers.

Airflow has the capability of reading connections, variables and configuration from Secret Backends rather
than from its own Database. While storing such information in Airflow's database is possible, many of the
enterprise customers already have some secret managers storing secrets, and Airflow can tap into those
via providers that implement secrets backends for services Airflow integrates with.

You can also take a
look at Secret backends available in the core Airflow in
:doc:`apache-airflow:security/secrets/secrets-backend/index` and here you can see the ones
provided by the community-managed providers:
