Auth backends
-------------

This is a summary of all Apache Airflow Community provided implementations of authentication backends
exposed via community-managed providers.

Airflow's authentication for web server and API is based on Flask Application Builder's authentication
capabilities. You can read more about those in
`FAB security docs <https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html>`_.

You can also
take a look at Auth backends available in the core Airflow in :doc:`apache-airflow:security/webserver`
or see those provided by the community-managed providers:
