Connections
-----------

This is a summary of all Apache Airflow Community provided implementations of connections
exposed via community-managed providers.

Airflow can be extended by providers with custom connections. Each provider can define their own custom
connections, that can define their own custom parameters and UI customizations/field behaviours for each
connection, when the connection is managed via Airflow UI. Those connections also define connection types,
that can be used to automatically create Airflow Hooks for specific connection types.

The connection management is explained in
:doc:`apache-airflow:concepts/connections` and you can also see those
provided by the community-managed providers:
