============================
Amazon DynamoDB to Amazon S3
============================

Use the ``DynamoDBToS3Operator`` transfer to copy the content of an existing Amazon DynamoDB table
to an existing Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.

Amazon DynamoDB To Amazon S3 transfer operator
==============================================

This operator replicates records from an Amazon DynamoDB table to a file in an Amazon S3 bucket.
It scans an Amazon DynamoDB table and writes the received records to a file on the local
filesystem. It flushes the file to Amazon S3 once the file size exceeds the file size limit
specified by the user.

Users can also specify a filtering criteria using ``dynamodb_scan_kwargs`` to only replicate
records that satisfy the criteria.

To get more information visit:
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.transfers.dynamodb_to_s3.DynamoDBToS3Operator`

Example usage:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dynamodb_to_s3.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_dynamodb_to_s3]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_dynamodb_to_s3]

To parallelize the replication, users can create multiple ``DynamoDBToS3Operator`` tasks using the
``TotalSegments`` parameter.  For instance to replicate with parallelism of 2, create two tasks:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dynamodb_to_s3.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_dynamodb_to_s3_segmented]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_dynamodb_to_s3_segmented]
