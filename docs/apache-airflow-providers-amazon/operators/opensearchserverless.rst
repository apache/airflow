Amazon OpenSearch Serverless
============================

`Amazon OpenSearch Serverless <https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/>`__  is an
on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon OpenSearch Service. An OpenSearch
Serverless collection is an OpenSearch cluster that scales compute capacity based on
your application's needs. This contrasts with OpenSearch Service provisioned OpenSearch
domains, which you manually manage capacity for.
