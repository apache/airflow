Amazon Glacier Operator
=======================

Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage classes for data archiving and long-term backup.

.. _howto/operator:GlacierCreateJobOperator:

GlacierCreateJobOperator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operator task is to initiate an Amazon Glacier inventory-retrieval job.
The operation returns dictionary of information related to the initiated job like *jobId* what is required for subsequent tasks.

To get more information about operator visit:
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.transfers.glacier_to_gcs.GlacierCreateJobOperator`

Example usage:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_glacier_to_gcs.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_glacier_create_job_operator]
    :end-before: [END howto_glacier_create_job_operator]

.. _howto/operator:GlacierJobOperationSensor:

GlacierJobOperationSensor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operator task is to wait until task *create_glacier_job* will be completed.
When sensor returns *true* then subsequent tasks can be executed.
In this case subsequent tasks are: *GlacierDownloadArchive* and *GlacierTransferDataToGCS*.

Job states:

* *Succeeded* – job is finished and for example archives from the vault can be downloaded
* *InProgress* – job is in progress and you have to wait until it's done (*Succeeded*)

GlacierJobOperationSensor checks the job status.
If response status code is *succeeded* then sensor returns *true* and subsequent tasks will be executed.
If response code is *InProgress* then sensor returns *false* and reschedule task with *poke_interval=60 * 20*.
Which means that every next request will be sent every 20 minutes.
