===================
Amazon Athena SQL
===================

`Amazon Athena <https://aws.amazon.com/athena/>`__ is an interactive query service
that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) using
standard SQL.  Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or
manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.  To get started, simply point
to your data in S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: ../../_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Operators
---------

Execute a SQL query
===================

The generic ``SQLExecuteQueryOperator`` can be used to execute SQL queries against Amazon Athena using a `Athena connection <../../connections/athena.html>`_.

To execute a single SQL query against an Amazon Athena without bringing back the results to Airflow,
please use ``AthenaOperator`` instead.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/common/sql/example_sql_execute_query.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sql_execute_query]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sql_execute_query]

Also, if you need to do simple data quality tests with Amazon Athena, you can use the ``SQLTableCheckOperator``

The below example demonstrates how to instantiate the SQLTableCheckOperator task.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/common/sql/example_sql_column_table_check.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sql_table_check]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sql_table_check]
