Amazon EMR Serverless Operators
===============================

`Amazon EMR Serverless <https://aws.amazon.com/emr/serverless/>`__ is a serverless option
in Amazon EMR that makes it easy for data analysts and engineers to run open-source big
data analytics frameworks without configuring, managing, and scaling clusters or servers.
You get all the features and benefits of Amazon EMR without the need for experts to plan
and manage clusters.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: ../../_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Operators
---------
.. _howto/operator:EmrServerlessCreateApplicationOperator:

Create an EMR Serverless Application
====================================

You can use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.emr.EmrServerlessCreateApplicationOperator` to
create a new EMR Serverless Application.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
the aiobotocore module to be installed.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_operator_emr_serverless_create_application]
   :end-before: [END howto_operator_emr_serverless_create_application]

.. _howto/operator:EmrServerlessStartJobOperator:

Start an EMR Serverless Job
============================

You can use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.emr.EmrServerlessStartJobOperator` to
start an EMR Serverless Job.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
the aiobotocore module to be installed.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_operator_emr_serverless_start_job]
   :end-before: [END howto_operator_emr_serverless_start_job]

.. _howto/operator:EmrServerlessStopApplicationOperator:

Open Application UIs
""""""""""""""""""""

The operator can also be configured to generate one-time links to the application UIs and Spark stdout logs
by passing the ``enable_application_ui_links=True`` as a parameter. Once the job starts running, these links
are available in the Details section of the relevant Task.

You need to ensure you have the following IAM permissions to generate the dashboard link.

.. code-block::

        "emr-serverless:GetDashboardForJobRun"

If Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudWatch logs are
`enabled for EMR Serverless <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/logging.html>`__,
links to the respective console will also be available in the task logs and task Details.

Stop an EMR Serverless Application
==================================

You can use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.emr.EmrServerlessStopApplicationOperator` to
stop an EMR Serverless Application.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
the aiobotocore module to be installed.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_operator_emr_serverless_stop_application]
   :end-before: [END howto_operator_emr_serverless_stop_application]

.. _howto/operator:EmrServerlessDeleteApplicationOperator:

Delete an EMR Serverless Application
====================================

You can use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.emr.EmrServerlessDeleteApplicationOperator` to
delete an EMR Serverless Application.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
the aiobotocore module to be installed.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_operator_emr_serverless_delete_application]
   :end-before: [END howto_operator_emr_serverless_delete_application]

Sensors
-------

.. _howto/sensor:EmrServerlessJobSensor:

Wait on an EMR Serverless Job state
===================================

To monitor the state of an EMR Serverless Job you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.emr.EmrServerlessJobSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_sensor_emr_serverless_job]
   :end-before: [END howto_sensor_emr_serverless_job]

.. _howto/sensor:EmrServerlessApplicationSensor:

Wait on an EMR Serverless Application state
============================================

To monitor the state of an EMR Serverless Application you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.emr.EmrServerlessApplicationSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_emr_serverless.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_sensor_emr_serverless_application]
   :end-before: [END howto_sensor_emr_serverless_application]
