Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
========================================

`Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`__  is a managed
service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers
and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to
a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the
SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Kinesis
Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text
messages (SMS).
