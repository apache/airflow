Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:NeptuneStartDbClusterOperator:

Start a Neptune database cluster
================================

To start a existing Neptune database cluster, you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.neptune.StartNeptuneDbClusterOperator`.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
the aiobotocore module to be installed.

.. note::
    This operator only starts an existing Neptune database cluster, it does not create a cluster.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_neptune.py

    :end-before: [END howto_operator_start_neptune_cluster]

.. _howto/operator:StopNeptuneDbClusterOperator:

Stop a Neptune database cluster
===============================

To stop a running Neptune database cluster, you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.neptune.StartNeptuneDbClusterOperator`.
This operator can be run in deferrable mode by passing ``deferrable=True`` as a parameter. This requires
