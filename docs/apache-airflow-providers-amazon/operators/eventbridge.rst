==================
Amazon EventBridge
==================

`Amazon Eventbridge <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/>`__ is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy
to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from
your own applications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such
as AWS Lambda. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures
that react in real time to all of your data sources. EventBridge enables you to build event-driven architectures
that are loosely coupled and distributed.
