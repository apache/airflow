Amazon Redshift Data
====================

`Amazon Redshift <https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/>`__ manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse:
provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to
the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your
business and customers.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:RedshiftDataOperator:

Execute a statement on an Amazon Redshift cluster
=================================================

Use the :class:`RedshiftDataOperator <airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.redshift_data>` to execute
statements against an Amazon Redshift cluster.

This differs from ``RedshiftSQLOperator`` in that it allows users to query and retrieve data via the AWS API and avoid
the necessity of a Postgres connection.
