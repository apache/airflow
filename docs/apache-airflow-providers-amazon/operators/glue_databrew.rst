`AWS Glue DataBrew <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/features/databrew/>`__ is a visual data preparation tool
that makes it easier for data analysts and data scientists to clean and normalize data to prepare it
for analytics and machine learning (ML). You can choose from over 250 prebuilt transformations to automate
data preparation tasks, all without the need to write any code. You can automate filtering anomalies, converting
data to standard formats and correcting invalid values, and other tasks.
After your data is ready, you can immediately use it for analytics and ML projects.
