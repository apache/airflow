==================
AWS CloudFormation
==================

`AWS CloudFormation <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`__ enables you to create and provision AWS
infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. It helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon
EC2, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly
reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and
configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudFormation enables you to use a template file to
create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack).

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: _partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:CloudFormationCreateStackOperator:

Create an AWS CloudFormation stack
==================================

To create a new AWS CloudFormation stack use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.cloud_formation.CloudFormationCreateStackOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_cloudformation.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloudformation_create_stack]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloudformation_create_stack]

.. _howto/operator:CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator:

Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack
==================================

To delete an AWS CloudFormation stack you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.cloud_formation.CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_cloudformation.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloudformation_delete_stack]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloudformation_delete_stack]

Sensors
-------

.. _howto/sensor:CloudFormationCreateStackSensor:

Wait on an AWS CloudFormation stack creation state
==================================================

To wait on the state of an AWS CloudFormation stack creation until it reaches a terminal state you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.cloud_formation.CloudFormationCreateStackSensor`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_cloudformation.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_cloudformation_create_stack]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_cloudformation_create_stack]

.. _howto/sensor:CloudFormationDeleteStackSensor:

Wait on an AWS CloudFormation stack deletion state
==================================================

To wait on the state of an AWS CloudFormation stack deletion until it reaches a terminal state you can use
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.cloud_formation.CloudFormationDeleteStackSensor`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_cloudformation.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_cloudformation_delete_stack]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_cloudformation_delete_stack]
