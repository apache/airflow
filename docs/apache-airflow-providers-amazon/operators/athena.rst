Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: _partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Using Operator
--------------
Use the
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.athena.AthenaOperator`
to run a query in Amazon Athena.  To get started with Amazon Athena please visit
`aws.amazon.com/athena <https://aws.amazon.com/athena>`_


In the following example, we create an Athena table and run a query based upon a CSV file
created in an S3 bucket and populated with SAMPLE_DATA.  The example waits for the query
to complete and then drops the created table and deletes the sample CSV file in the S3
bucket.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_athena.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_athena_operator_and_sensor]
    :end-before: [END howto_athena_operator_and_sensor]

More information
