=============
Amazon Athena
=============

`Amazon Athena <https://aws.amazon.com/athena/>`__ is an interactive query service
that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) using
standard SQL.  Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or
manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.  To get started, simply point
to your data in S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL.

Prerequisite Tasks

Operators

.. _howto/operator:AthenaOperator:

Run a query in Amazon Athena
============================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.athena.AthenaOperator`
to run a query in Amazon Athena.

In the following example, we query an existing Athena table and send the results to
an existing Amazon S3 bucket.  For more examples of how to use this operator, please
see the `Sample DAG <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/|version|/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_athena.py>`__.
