AWS Step Functions
==================

`AWS Step Functions <https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/>`__ makes it easy to coordinate the components
of distributed applications as a series of steps in a visual workflow. You can quickly build and run state
machines to execute the steps of your application in a reliable and scalable fashion.

Prerequisite Tasks
------------------

.. include:: _partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Operators
---------

.. _howto/operator:StepFunctionStartExecutionOperator:

Start an AWS Step Functions state machine execution
===================================================

To start a new AWS Step Functions state machine execution you can use
:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.step_function.StepFunctionStartExecutionOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_step_functions.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_step_function_start_execution]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_step_function_start_execution]

.. _howto/operator:StepFunctionGetExecutionOutputOperator:

Get an AWS Step Functions execution output
==========================================

To fetch the output from an AWS Step Function state machine execution you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.step_function.StepFunctionGetExecutionOutputOperator`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_step_functions.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_step_function_get_execution_output]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_step_function_get_execution_output]

Sensors
-------

.. _howto/sensor:StepFunctionExecutionSensor:

Wait on an AWS Step Functions state machine execution state
===========================================================

To wait on the state of an AWS Step Function state machine execution until it reaches a terminal state you can
use :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.step_function.StepFunctionExecutionSensor`.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_step_functions.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_sensor_step_function_execution]
    :end-before: [END howto_sensor_step_function_execution]
