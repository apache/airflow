How-to Guide for Chime notifications
====================================

Introduction
------------
Chime notifier (:class:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.notifications.chime.ChimeNotifier`) allows users to send
messages to a Chime chat room setup via a webhook using the various ``on_*_callbacks`` at both the DAG level and Task level

You can also use a notifier with ``sla_miss_callback``.

.. note::
    When notifiers are used with `sla_miss_callback` the context will contain only values passed to the callback, refer :ref:`sla_miss_callback<concepts:sla_miss_callback>`.

Example Code:
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
    from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.notifications.chime import send_chime_notification

    with DAG(
        dag_id="mydag",
        schedule="@once",
        start_date=datetime(2023, 6, 27),
        on_success_callback=[
            send_chime_notification(chime_conn_id="my_chime_conn", message="The DAG {{ dag.dag_id }} succeeded")
        ],
        catchup=False,
    ):
        BashOperator(
            task_id="mytask",
            on_failure_callback=[
                send_chime_notification(chime_conn_id="my_chime_conn", message="The task {{ ti.task_id }} failed")
            ],
            bash_command="fail",
        )
