Amazon S3 To DynamoDB transfer operator
==============================================

This operator loads data from Amazon S3 to an Amazon DynamoDB table. It uses the Amazon DynamoDB
ImportTable Services that interacts with different AWS Services such Amazon S3 and CloudWatch. The
default behavior is to load S3 data into a new Amazon DynamoDB table. The import into an existing
table is currently not supported by the Service. Thus, the operator uses a custom approach. It creates
a temporary DynamoDB table and loads S3 data into the table. Then it scans the temporary Amazon
DynamoDB table and writes the received records to the target table.

Example usage:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_s3_to_dynamodb.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_s3_to_dynamodb]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_s3_to_dynamodb]


To load S3 data into an existing DynamoDB table use:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_s3_to_dynamodb.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_s3_to_dynamodb_existing_table]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_s3_to_dynamodb_existing_table]
