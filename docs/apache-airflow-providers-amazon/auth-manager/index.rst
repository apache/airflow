.. warning::
  The AWS auth manager is alpha/experimental at the moment and may be subject to change without warning.

Before reading this, you should be familiar with the concept of auth manager.
See :doc:`apache-airflow:core-concepts/auth-manager`.

The AWS auth manager is an auth manager powered by AWS. It uses two services:

* `AWS IAM Identity Center <https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/>`_ for authentication purposes
* `Amazon Verified Permissions <https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions/>`_ for authorization purposes
