AWS Secrets Manager Backend
===========================

To enable Secrets Manager, specify :py:class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.secrets.secrets_manager.SecretsManagerBackend`
as the ``backend`` in  ``[secrets]`` section of ``airflow.cfg``. These ``backend_kwargs`` are parsed as JSON, hence Python
values like the bool False or None will be ignored, taking for those kwargs the default values of the secrets backend.

Here is a sample configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.amazon.aws.secrets.secrets_manager.SecretsManagerBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow/connections", "variables_prefix": "airflow/variables", "profile_name": "default"}

To authenticate you can either supply arguments listed in
:ref:`Amazon Webservices Connection Extra config <howto/connection:aws:configuring-the-connection>` or set
`environment variables <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-environment-variables>`__.

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.amazon.aws.secrets.secrets_manager.SecretsManagerBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow/connections", "variables_prefix": "airflow/variables", "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789098:role/role-name"}


Storing and Retrieving Connections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to store Airflow connections in AWS Secrets Manager.

Storing a Connection as a URI
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can store the connection as an Airflow connection URI:

.. image:: /img/aws-secrets-manager-uri.png

Note that every field is assumed to be URL-encoded if you store the connection as a URI.
For example, if you want to use the value ``my password``, in the URI, it should be represented as ``my%20password``.

Storing a Connection as a JSON
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can also store the connection as a JSON with the appropriate key-value pairs:

.. image:: /img/aws-secrets-manager-json.png

Using Airflow default names for connection fields is encouraged, but different aliases are allowed for each field:

* Connection type: ``conn_type``, ``conn_id``, ``connection_type``, ``engine``
* Login: ``login``, ``user``, ``username``, ``user_name``
* Password: ``password``, ``pass``, ``key``
* Host: ``host``, ``remote_host``, ``server``
* Port: ``port``
* Extra: ``extra``. Note that this extra field should be a valid JSON.

More words can be added to the list using the parameter ``extra_conn_words`` in the configuration. This
parameter has to be a dict of lists with the following optional keys: user, password, host, schema, conn_type.

As an example, if you have set ``connections_prefix`` as ``airflow/connections``, then for a connection id of ``smtp_default``,
you would want to store your connection at ``airflow/connections/smtp_default``. This can be done through the AWS web
console or through Amazon CLI as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
        --secret-id airflow/connections/smtp_default \
        --secret-string '{"login": "nice_user", "password": "this_is_the_password", "host": "ec2.8399.com", "port": "999"}'

Verify that you can get the secret:

.. code-block:: console

    ‚ùØ aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id airflow/connections/smtp_default
    {
        "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:314524341751:secret:airflow/connections/smtp_default-7meuul",
        "Name": "airflow/connections/smtp_default",
        "VersionId": "34f90eff-ea21-455a-9c8f-5ee74b21be672",
        "SecretString": "{\n  \"login\":\"nice_user\",\n  \"password\":\"this_is_the_password\"\n,
        \n  \"host\":\"ec2.8399.com\"\n,\n  \"port\":\"999\"\n}\n",
        "VersionStages": [
            "AWSCURRENT"
        ],
        "CreatedDate": "2020-04-08T02:10:35.132000+01:00"
    }

If you don't want to use any ``connections_prefix`` for retrieving connections, set it as an empty string ``""`` in the configuration.

Storing and Retrieving Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have set ``variables_prefix`` as ``airflow/variables``, then for an Variable key of ``hello``,
you would want to store your Variable at ``airflow/variables/hello``.

Optional lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optionally connections, variables, or config may be looked up exclusive of each other or in any combination.
This will prevent requests being sent to AWS Secrets Manager for the excluded type.

If you want to look up some and not others in AWS Secrets Manager you may do so by setting the relevant ``*_prefix`` parameter of the ones to be excluded as ``null``.

For example, if you want to set parameter ``connections_prefix`` to ``"airflow/connections"`` and not look up variables, your configuration file should look like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [secrets]
    backend = airflow.providers.amazon.aws.secrets.secrets_manager.SecretsManagerBackend
    backend_kwargs = {"connections_prefix": "airflow/connections", "variables_prefix": null, "profile_name": "default"}

Example of storing Google Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For connecting to a google cloud conn, all the fields must be in the extra field, and their names follow the pattern
``extra_google_cloud_platform__value``. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

  {'key_path': '/opt/airflow/service_account.json',
  'scope': 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only'}
