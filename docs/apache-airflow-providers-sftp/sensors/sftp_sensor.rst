SFTP Sensor
===========

Looks for either a specific file or files with a specific pattern in a server using SFTP protocol.
To get more information about this sensor visit :class:`~airflow.providers.sftp.sensors.sftp.SFTPSensor`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/sftp/example_sftp_sensor.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sftp_sensor]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sftp_sensor]


We can also use Taskflow API. It takes the same arguments as the :class:`~airflow.providers.sftp.sensors.sftp.SFTPSensor` along with -

op_args (optional)
    A list of positional arguments that will get unpacked when
    calling your callable (templated)
op_kwargs (optional)
    A dictionary of keyword arguments that will get unpacked
    in your function (templated)

Whatever returned by the python callable is put into XCom.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/sftp/example_sftp_sensor.py

    :start-after: [START howto_operator_sftp_sensor_decorator]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_sftp_sensor_decorator]
