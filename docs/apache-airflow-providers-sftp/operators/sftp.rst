SFTPOperator
==========================
Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.sftp.operators.sftp.py` to
transfer data between servers under sftp.

Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To start working with an operator, you need to register an SFTP \ SSH connection in Airflow Connections.
Use ssh_conn_id to specify the name of the connection.

You can use the operator for the following tasks:
1. Send one file to the server with the full path

.. exampleinclude airflow/providers/sftp/example_dags/example_sftp_operator.py
  :language: python
    put_file = SFTPOperator(
        task_id="put_file",
        ssh_conn_id="ssh_default",
        local_filepath="/tmp/transfer_file/put_file_file1.txt",
        remote_filepath="/tmp/transfer_file/remote/put_file_file1.txt",
        operation=SFTPOperation.PUT,
        create_intermediate_dirs=True
    )

2. Send multiple files to the specified directory on the remote server

.. exampleinclude airflow/providers/sftp/example_dags/example_sftp_operator.py
  :language: python
    put_files = SFTPOperator(
        task_id="put_files",
        ssh_conn_id="ssh_default",
        local_filepath=["/tmp/transfer_file/put_files_file1.txt", "/tmp/transfer_file/put_files_file2.txt"],
        remote_filepath="/tmp/transfer_file/remote/",
        operation=SFTPOperation.PUT,
        create_intermediate_dirs=True
    )

3. Send all files from local directory to remote server

.. exampleinclude airflow/providers/sftp/example_dags/example_sftp_operator.py
  :language: python
     put_dir_files = SFTPOperator(
        task_id="put_dir_files",
        ssh_conn_id="ssh_default",
        local_folder="/tmp/dir_for_remote_transfer/",
        remote_folder="/tmp/dir_for_remote_transfer/remote/",
        operation=SFTPOperation.PUT,
        create_intermediate_dirs=True
    )

4. Send all files from the local directory that match the specified pattern to the remote server

.. exampleinclude airflow/providers/sftp/example_dags/example_sftp_operator.py
  :language: python
    put_dir_txt_files = SFTPOperator(
        task_id="put_dir_txt_files",
        ssh_conn_id="ssh_default",
        local_folder="/tmp/dir_for_remote_transfer/",
        remote_folder="/tmp/dir_for_remote_transfer/remote/txt/",
        regexp_mask=".*.txt",
        operation=SFTPOperation.PUT,
        create_intermediate_dirs=True
    )

The operator also supports transfer files from a remote server to a local,
for this you need to change the parameter ``operation`` from ``SFTPOperation.PUT`` to ``SFTPOperation.GET``.
Parameter ``create_intermediate_dirs`` needed for create missing intermediate directories when
copying from remote to local and vice-versa. Default is False.
