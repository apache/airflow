Google OpenID authentication
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You can also configure
`Google OpenID <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect>`__
for authentication. To enable it, set the following option in the configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [api]
    auth_backend = airflow.providers.google.common.auth_backend.google_openid

It is also highly recommended to configure an OAuth2 audience so that the generated tokens are restricted to
use by Airflow only.

.. code-block:: ini

    [api]
    google_oauth2_audience = project-id-random-value.apps.googleusercontent.com

You can also configure the CLI to send request to a remote API instead of making a query to a local database.

.. code-block:: ini

    [cli]
    api_client = airflow.api.client.json_client
    endpoint_url = http://remote-host.example.org/

You can also set up a service account key. If omitted, authorization based on `the Application Default
Credentials <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#finding_credentials_automatically>`__
will be used.

.. code-block:: ini

    [cli]
    google_key_path = <KEY_PATH>

You can get the authorization token with the ``gcloud auth print-identity-token`` command. An example request
look like the following.

  .. code-block:: bash

      ENDPOINT_URL="http://locahost:8080/"

      AUDIENCE="project-id-random-value.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      ID_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-identity-token "--audience=${AUDIENCE}")"

      curl -X GET  \
          "${ENDPOINT_URL}/api/experimental/pools" \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ID_TOKEN}"
