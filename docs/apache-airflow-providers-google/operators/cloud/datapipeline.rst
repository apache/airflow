Google Cloud Data Pipelines Operators
===============================

Data Pipelines is a Dataflow feature that allows customers to create 
and schedule recurring jobs, view aggregated job metrics, and define 
and manage job SLOs. A pipeline consists of a collection of jobs 
including ways to manage them. A pipeline may be associated with a 
Dataflow Template (classic/flex) and include all jobs launched with 
the associated template.
