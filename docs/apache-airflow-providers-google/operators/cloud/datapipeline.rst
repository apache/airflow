Google Cloud Data Pipelines Operators
=====================================

Data Pipelines is a Dataflow feature that allows customers to create
and schedule recurring jobs, view aggregated job metrics, and define
and manage job SLOs. A pipeline consists of a collection of jobs
including ways to manage them. A pipeline may be associated with a
Dataflow Template (classic/flex) and include all jobs launched with
the associated template.

Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /operators/_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Creating a Data Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new Data Pipelines instance using a request body and parent name, use :class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.datapipeline.CreateDataPipelineOperator`.
The operator accesses Google Cloud's Data Pipelines API and calls upon the
`create method <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/data-pipelines/rest/v1/projects.locations.pipelines/create>`__
to run the given pipeline.

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.datapipeline.CreateDataPipelineOperator` accepts four parameters:
   **body**: instance of the Pipeline,
   **project_id**: id of the GCP project that owns the job,
   **location**: destination for the Pipeline,
   **gcp_conn_id**: id to connect to Google Cloud.

The request body and project id need to be passed each time, while the GCP connection id and location have default values.
The project id and location will be used to build the parent name needed to create the operator.

Here is an example of how you can create a Data Pipelines instance by running the above parameters with CreateDataPipelineOperator:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/datapipelines/example_datapipeline.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: [START howto_operator_create_data_pipeline]
   :end-before: [END howto_operator_create_data_pipeline]

Running a Data Pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run a Data Pipelines instance, use :class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.datapipeline.RunDataPipelineOperator`.
The operator accesses Google Cloud's Data Pipelines API and calls upon the
`run method <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/data-pipelines/rest/v1/projects.locations.pipelines/run>`__
to run the given pipeline.

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.datapipeline.RunDataPipelineOperator` can take in four parameters:

- ``data_pipeline_name``: the name of the Data Pipelines instance
- ``project_id``: the ID of the GCP project that owns the job
- ``location``: the location of the Data Pipelines instance
- ``gcp_conn_id``: the connection ID to connect to the Google Cloud Platform

Only the Data Pipeline name and Project ID are required parameters, as the Location and GCP Connection ID have default values.
The Project ID and Location will be used to build the parent name, which is where the given Data Pipeline should be located.

You can run a Data Pipelines instance by running the above parameters with RunDataPipelineOperator:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/datapipelines/example_datapipeline.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_run_data_pipeline]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_run_data_pipeline]

Once called, the RunDataPipelineOperator will return the Google Cloud `Dataflow Job <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/data-pipelines/rest/v1/Job>`__
created by running the given pipeline.

For further information regarding the API usage, see
`Data Pipelines API REST Resource <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/data-pipelines/rest/v1/projects.locations.pipelines#Pipeline>`__
in the Google Cloud documentation.
