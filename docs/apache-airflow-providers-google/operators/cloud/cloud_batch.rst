Google Cloud Batch Operators
===============================

Cloud Batch is a fully managed batch service to schedule, queue, and execute batch jobs on Google's infrastructure.

For more information about the service visit `Google Cloud Batch documentation <https://cloud.google.com/batch>`__.

Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /operators/_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Submit a job
---------------------

Before you submit a job in Cloud Batch, you need to define it.
For more information about the Job object fields, visit `Google Cloud Batch Job description <https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/batch/latest/google.cloud.batch_v1.types.Job>`__.

A simple job configuration can look as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 0
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_job_creation]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_job_creation]

With this configuration we can submit the job:
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_batch.CloudBatchSubmitJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_submit_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_submit_job]

or you can define the same operator in the deferrable mode:
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_batch.CloudBatchSubmitJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_submit_job_deferrable_mode]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_submit_job_deferrable_mode]

Note that this operator waits for the job complete its execution, and the Job's dictionary representation is pushed to XCom.

List a job's tasks
------------------

To list the tasks of a certain job, you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_batch.CloudBatchListTasksOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_list_tasks]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_list_tasks]

The operator takes two optional parameters: "limit" to limit the number of tasks returned, and "filter" to only list the tasks matching the `filter <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters>`__.

List jobs
----------------------

To list the jobs, you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_batch.CloudBatchListJobsOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_batch_list_jobs]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_batch_list_jobs]

The operator takes two optional parameters: "limit" to limit the number of tasks returned, and "filter" to only list the tasks matching the `filter <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/filters>`__.

Delete a job
-----------------

To delete a job you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_batch.CloudBatchDeleteJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_batch/example_cloud_batch.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_delete_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_delete_job]


Note that this operator waits for the job to be deleted, and the deleted Job's dictionary representation is pushed to XCom.
