Google Cloud Run Operators
===============================

Cloud Run is used to build and deploy scalable containerized apps written in any language (including Go, Python, Java, Node.js, .NET, and Ruby) on a fully managed platform.

For more information about the service visit `Google Cloud Run documentation <https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/>`__.

Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /operators/_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Create a job
---------------------

Before you create a job in Cloud Run, you need to define it.
For more information about the Job object fields, visit `Google Cloud Run Job description <https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.run.v2#google.cloud.run.v2.Job>`__

A simple job configuration can look as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 0
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_job_creation]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_job_creation]


With this configuration we can create the job:
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunCreateJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_create_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_create_job]


Note that this operator only creates the job without executing it. The Job's dictionary representation is pushed to XCom.

Execute a job
---------------------

To execute a job, you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunExecuteJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job]

or you can define the same operator in the deferrable mode:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunExecuteJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job_deferrable_mode]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job_deferrable_mode]

You can also specify overrides that allow you to give a new entrypoint command to the job and more:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunExecuteJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job_with_overrides]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_execute_job_with_overrides]


Update a job
------------------

To update a job, you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunUpdateJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_update_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_update_job]


The Job's dictionary representation is pushed to XCom.


List jobs
----------------------

To list the jobs, you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunListJobsOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_run_list_jobs]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_run_list_jobs]

The operator takes two optional parameters: "limit" to limit the number of tasks returned, and "show_deleted" to include deleted jobs in the result.


Delete a job
-----------------

To delete a job you can use:

:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_run.CloudRunDeleteJobOperator`

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/cloud_run/example_cloud_run.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_cloud_delete_job]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_cloud_delete_job]

Note this operator waits for the job to be deleted, and the deleted Job's dictionary representation is pushed to XCom.
