Transfer Data from Amazon S3 to Google Cloud Storage
====================================================
The `Google Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`__  (GCS) is used to store large
data from various applications. This is also the same with `Amazon Simple Storage Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html>`__.
This page shows how to transfer data from Amazon S3 to GCS.

Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /operators/_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.s3_to_gcs.S3ToGCSOperator`
to transfer data from Amazon S3 to Google Cloud Storage.

.. exampleinclude::/../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/gcs/example_s3_to_gcs.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_s3togcs_operator]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_s3togcs_operator]

There is a possibility to start S3ToGCSOperator asynchronously using deferrable mode. To do so just add parameter
``deferrable=True`` into the operator call. Under the hood it will delegate data transfer to Google Cloud Storage
Transfer Service. By changing parameter ``poll_interval=10`` you can control frequency of polling a transfer
job status.

.. exampleinclude::/../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/gcs/example_s3_to_gcs_async.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_transfer_s3togcs_operator_async]
    :end-before: [END howto_transfer_s3togcs_operator_async]
