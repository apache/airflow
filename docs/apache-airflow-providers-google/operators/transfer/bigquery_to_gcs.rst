Google Cloud BigQuery Transfer Operator to Google Cloud Storage
===============================================================

`Google Cloud BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery>`__ is Google Cloud's serverless
data warehouse offering.
`Google Cloud Storage (GCS) <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`__ is a managed service for
storing unstructured data.
This operator can be used to export data from BigQuery tables into files in a
Cloud Storage bucket.


Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _howto/operator:BigQueryToGCSOperator:

Operator
^^^^^^^^

File transfer from GCS to BigQuery is performed with the
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.bigquery_to_gcs.BigQueryToGCSOperator` operator.

Use :ref:`Jinja templating <concepts:jinja-templating>` with
:template-fields:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.bigquery_to_gcs.BigQueryToGCSOperator`
to define values dynamically.

You may define multiple destination URIs, as well as other settings such as ``compression`` and
``export_format``. For more information, please refer to the links above.


Importing files
---------------

The following Operator imports one or more files from GCS into a BigQuery table.
