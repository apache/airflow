Google Drive to Google Cloud Storage Transfer Operator
=======================================================

Google has two services that store data. The `Google Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`__ is
used to store large data from various applications. The `Google Drive <https://www.google.com/drive/>`__ is
used to store daily use data, including documents and photos. Google Cloud Storage has strong integration
with Google Cloud services. Google Drive has built-in mechanisms to facilitate group work e.g.
document editor, file sharing mechanisms.

Operator
^^^^^^^^

Transfer files between Google Storage and Google Drive is performed with the
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gdrive_to_gcs.GoogleDriveToGCSOperator` operator.


Copy single files
-----------------

The following Operator copies a single file from a shared Google Drive folder to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket.

Note that you can transfer a file from the root folder of a shared drive by passing the id of the shared
drive to both the ``folder_id`` and ``drive_id`` parameters.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_gdrive_to_gcs.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START upload_gdrive_to_gcs]
    :end-before: [END upload_gdrive_to_gcs]

You can use :ref:`Jinja templating <jinja-templating>` with
:template-fields:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gdrive_to_gcs.GoogleDriveToGCSOperator`
parameters which allows you to dynamically determine values.
