Google Cloud Storage Transfer Operator to BigQuery
==================================================

`Google Cloud Storage (GCS) <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`__ is a managed service for
storing unstructured data.
`Google Cloud BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery>`__ is Google Cloud's serverless
data warehouse offering.
This operator can be used to populate BigQuery tables with data from files stored in a
Cloud Storage bucket.


Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /operators/_partials/prerequisite_tasks.rst

.. _howto/operator:GCSToBigQueryOperator:

Operator
^^^^^^^^

File transfer from GCS to BigQuery is performed with the
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery.GCSToBigQueryOperator` operator.

Use :ref:`Jinja templating <concepts:jinja-templating>` with
:template-fields:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery.GCSToBigQueryOperator`
to define values dynamically.

You may load multiple objects from a single bucket using the ``source_objects`` parameter.
You may also define a schema, as well as additional settings such as the compression format.
For more information, please refer to the links above.

Transferring files
------------------

The following Operator transfers one or more files from GCS into a BigQuery table.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/gcs/example_gcs_to_bigquery.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_gcs_to_bigquery]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_gcs_to_bigquery]

Also you can use GCSToBigQueryOperator in the deferrable mode:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/google/cloud/gcs/example_gcs_to_bigquery_async.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_gcs_to_bigquery_async]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_gcs_to_bigquery_async]
