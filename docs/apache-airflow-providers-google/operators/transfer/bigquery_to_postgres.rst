Google Cloud BigQuery Transfer Operator to Postgres
===================================================

`Google Cloud BigQuery <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery>`__ is Google Cloud's serverless
data warehouse offering.
`PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`__ is an open-source relational database management system.
This operator can be used to copy data from a BigQuery table to PostgreSQL.


Prerequisite Tasks

Operator
^^^^^^^^

Copying data from BigQuery table to Postgres table is performed with the
:class:`~airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.bigquery_to_postgres.BigQueryToPostgresOperator` operator.

Use :ref:`Jinja templating <concepts:jinja-templating>` with
:template-fields:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.bigquery_to_postgres.BigQueryToPostgresOperator`
to define values dynamically.

You may use the parameter ``selected_fields`` to limit the fields to be copied (all fields by default),
as well as the parameter ``replace`` to overwrite the destination table instead of appending to it.
For more information, please refer to the links above.
