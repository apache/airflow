How-to Guide for YDB using YDBExecuteQueryOperator
==================================================

Introduction
------------

Apache Airflow has a robust trove of operators that can be used to implement the various tasks that make up your
workflow. Airflow is essentially a graph (Directed Acyclic Graph) made up of tasks (nodes) and dependencies (edges).

A task defined or implemented by a operator is a unit of work in your data pipeline.

The purpose of this guide is to define tasks involving interactions with a YDB database with
the :class:`~airflow.providers.ydb.operators.YDBExecuteQueryOperator`.

Common database operations with YDBExecuteQueryOperator
-------------------------------------------------------

YDBExecuteQueryOperator executes either DML or DDL query. Parameters of the operators are:

- ``sql`` - string with query;
- ``is_ddl`` - flag indicating that query is DDL. By default is ``false``;
- ``conn_id`` - YDB connection id. Default value is ``ydb_default``;
- ``params`` - parameters to be injected into query if it is Jinja template, more details about :doc:`params <apache-airflow:core-concepts/params>`


.. note::
    Parameter ``is_ddl`` could be removed in future versions of operator.

Creating an YDB table
---------------------

The code snippets below are based on Airflow-2.0

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/ydb/example_ydb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START ydb_operator_howto_guide]
    :end-before: [END ydb_operator_howto_guide_create_pet_table]


Dumping SQL statements into your operator isn't quite appealing and will create maintainability pains somewhere
down to the road. To prevent this, Airflow offers an elegant solution. This is how it works: you simply create
a directory inside the DAG folder called ``sql`` and then put all the SQL files containing your SQL queries inside it.

Your ``dags/sql/pet_schema.sql`` should like this:

::

      -- create pet table
      CREATE TABLE pet (
        pet_id INT,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        pet_type TEXT NOT NULL,
        birth_date TEXT NOT NULL,
        owner TEXT NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (pet_id)
      );

Now let's refactor ``create_pet_table`` in our DAG:

.. code-block:: python

        create_pet_table = YDBExecuteQueryOperator(
            task_id="create_pet_table",
            sql="sql/pet_schema.sql",
        )


Inserting data into an YDB table
--------------------------------

Let's say we already have the SQL insert statement below in our ``dags/sql/pet_schema.sql`` file:

::

  -- populate pet table
  UPSERT INTO pet (pet_id, name, pet_type, birth_date, owner)
  VALUES (1, 'Max', 'Dog', '2018-07-05', 'Jane');

  UPSERT INTO pet (pet_id, name, pet_type, birth_date, owner)
  VALUES (2, 'Susie', 'Cat', '2019-05-01', 'Phil');

  UPSERT INTO pet (pet_id, name, pet_type, birth_date, owner)
  VALUES (3, 'Lester', 'Hamster', '2020-06-23', 'Lily');

  UPSERT INTO pet (pet_id, name, pet_type, birth_date, owner)
  VALUES (4, 'Quincy', 'Parrot', '2013-08-11', 'Anne');

We can then create a YDBExecuteQueryOperator task that populate the ``pet`` table.

.. code-block:: python

  populate_pet_table = YDBExecuteQueryOperator(
      task_id="populate_pet_table",
      sql="sql/pet_schema.sql",
  )


Fetching records from your YDB table
------------------------------------

Fetching records from your YDB table can be as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

  get_all_pets = YDBExecuteQueryOperator(
      task_id="get_all_pets",
      sql="SELECT * FROM pet;",
  )


Passing parameters into YDBExecuteQueryOperator
-----------------------------------------------

The BaseOperator class has the ``params`` attribute which is available to the YDBExecuteQueryOperator
by virtue of inheritance. ``params`` make it possible to dynamically pass in parameters in many
interesting ways.

To find the owner of the pet called 'Lester':

.. code-block:: python

  get_birth_date = YDBExecuteQueryOperator(
      task_id="get_birth_date",
      sql="SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '{{params.begin_date}}' AND '{{params.end_date}}'",
      params={"begin_date": "2020-01-01", "end_date": "2020-12-31"},
  )

Now lets refactor our ``get_birth_date`` task. Instead of dumping SQL statements directly into our code, let's tidy things up
by creating a sql file.

::

  -- dags/sql/birth_date.sql
  SELECT * FROM pet WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '{{params.begin_date}}' AND '{{params.end_date}}';


.. code-block:: python

  get_birth_date = YDBExecuteQueryOperator(
      task_id="get_birth_date",
      sql="sql/birth_date.sql",
      params={"begin_date": "2020-01-01", "end_date": "2020-12-31"},
  )


The complete YDB Operator DAG
-----------------------------

When we put everything together, our DAG should look like this:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/ydb/example_ydb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START ydb_operator_howto_guide]
    :end-before: [END ydb_operator_howto_guide]


Conclusion
----------

In this how-to guide we explored the Apache Airflow YDBExecuteQueryOperator to connect to YDB database. Let's quickly highlight the key takeaways.
It is best practice to create subdirectory called ``sql`` in your ``dags`` directory where you can store your sql files.
This will make your code more elegant and more maintainable.
And finally, we looked at the templated version of sql script and usage of ``params`` attribute.
