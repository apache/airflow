Apache Kafka Operators
======================

.. _howto/operator:ConsumeFromTopicOperator:

ConsumeFromTopicOperator
------------------------

An operator that consumes from one or more Kafka topic(s) and processes the messages.
The operator creates a Kafka Consumer that reads a batch of messages from the cluster and processes them using the user-supplied callable ``apply_function``. The consumer will continue to read in batches until it reaches the end of the log or a maximum number of messages read (``max_messages``) is reached.

For parameter definitions take a look at :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.kafka.operators.consume.ConsumeFromTopicOperator`.

.. _howto/operator:ProduceToTopicOperator:

ProduceToTopicOperator
------------------------

An operator that produces messages to a Kafka topic. The operator will produce messages created as key/value pairs by the user-supplied ``producer_function``.
