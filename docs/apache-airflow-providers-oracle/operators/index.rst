Oracle Operators
================
The Oracle connection type provides connection to a Oracle database.

Execute SQL in an Oracle database
---------------------------------

To execute arbitrary SQL in an Oracle database, use the
:class:`~airflow.providers.oracle.operators.oracle.OracleOperator`.

An example of executing a simple query is as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/oracle/example_dags/example_oracle.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_oracle_operator]
    :end-before: [END howto_oracle_operator]


Execute a Stored Procedure in an Oracle database
------------------------------------------------

To execute a Stored Procedure in an Oracle database, use the
:class:`~airflow.providers.oracle.operators.oracle.OracleStoredProcedureOperator`.

Assume a stored procedure exists in the database that looks like this:

    .. code-block:: sql

        CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE
        TEST_PROCEDURE (val_in IN INT, val_out OUT INT) AS
        BEGIN
        val_out := val_in * 2;
        END;
        /

This stored procedure accepts a single integer argument, val_in, and outputs
a single integer argument, val_out. This can be represented with the following
call using :class:`~airflow.providers.oracle.operators.oracle.OracleStoredProcedureOperator`
with parameters passed positionally as a list:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/oracle/example_dags/example_oracle.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_oracle_stored_procedure_operator_with_list_inout]
    :end-before: [END howto_oracle_stored_procedure_operator_with_list_inout]


Alternatively, parameters can be passed as keyword arguments using a dictionary
as well.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/oracle/example_dags/example_oracle.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_oracle_stored_procedure_operator_with_dict_inout]
    :end-before: [END howto_oracle_stored_procedure_operator_with_dict_inout]

Both input and output will be passed to xcom provided that xcom push is requested.

More on stored procedure execution can be found in `oracledb documentation
<https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/plsql_execution.html#pl-sql-stored-procedures>`_.
