Operators
=======================
You can build your own Operator hook in :class:`~airflow.providers.arangodb.hooks.ArangoDBHook`,


Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.arangodb.operators.AQLOperator` to execute
AQL query in `ArangoDB <https://www.arangodb.com/>`__.

You can further process your result using :class:`~airflow.providers.arangodb.operators.AQLOperator` and
further process the result using **result_processor** Callable as you like.

An example of Listing all Documents in **students** collection can be implemented as following:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/arangodb/example_dags/example_arangodb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_aql_operator_arangodb]
    :end-before: [END howto_aql_operator_arangodb]

You can also provide file template (.sql) to load query, remember path is relative to **dags/** folder, if you want to provide any other path
please provide **template_searchpath** while creating **DAG** object,

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/arangodb/example_dags/example_arangodb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_aql_operator_template_file_arangodb]
    :end-before: [END howto_aql_operator_template_file_arangodb]

Sensors
=======

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.arangodb.sensors.AQLSensor` to wait for a document or collection using
AQL query in `ArangoDB <https://www.arangodb.com/>`__.

An example for waiting a document in **students** collection with student name **judy** can be implemented as following:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/arangodb/example_dags/example_arangodb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_aql_sensor_arangodb]
    :end-before: [END howto_aql_sensor_arangodb]

Similar to **AQLOperator**, You can also provide file template to load query -

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/arangodb/example_dags/example_arangodb.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_aql_sensor_template_file_arangodb]
    :end-before: [END howto_aql_sensor_template_file_arangodb]
