          connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or
          is issuing operations on the subscription. If expiration_policy is not set,
          a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for
          expiration_policy.ttl is 1 day.

      :type filter_: str
      :param dead_letter_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
          messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is
          disabled.

      :param retry_policy: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery
          for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This
          generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy
          subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline
          exceeded events for a given message.
      :type retry_policy: Union[Dict, google.cloud.pubsub_v1.types.RetryPolicy]
