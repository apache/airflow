       :ref:`howto/operator:CloudVisionCreateProductSetOperator`

   :param product_set: (Required) The ProductSet to create. If a dict is provided, it must be of the same
       form as the protobuf message `ProductSet`.
   :type product_set: dict or google.cloud.vision_v1.types.ProductSet
   :param location: (Required) The region where the ProductSet should be created. Valid regions

       missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :type project_id: str
   :param product_set_id: (Optional) A user-supplied resource id for this ProductSet.
       If set, the server will attempt to use this value as the resource id. If it is
       already in use, an error is returned with code ALREADY_EXISTS. Must be at most
       128 characters long. It cannot contain the character /.

   Makes changes to a `ProductSet` resource. Only display_name can be updated currently.

   .. note:: To locate the `ProductSet` resource, its `name` in the form
       `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID` is necessary.

   You can provide the `name` directly as an attribute of the `product_set` object.
   However, you can leave it blank and provide `location` and `product_set_id` instead
   (and optionally `project_id` - if not present, the connection default will be used)
   and the `name` will be created by the operator itself.

   This mechanism exists for your convenience, to allow leaving the `project_id` empty
   and having Airflow use the connection default `project_id`.
