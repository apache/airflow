DatabricksSubmitRunOperator
===========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.databricks.operators.DatabricksSubmitRunOperator` to submit
an existing Spark job run to Databricks api/2.0/jobs/runs/submit <https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runs-submit> API endpoint.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to instantiate this operator. In the first way, you can take the JSON payload that you typically use
to call the ``api/2.0/jobs/runs/submit`` endpoint and pass it directly to our ``DatabricksSubmitRunOperator`` through the ``json`` parameter.

Another way to accomplish the same thing is to use the named parameters of the ``DatabricksSubmitRunOperator`` directly. Note that there is exactly
one named parameter for each top level parameter in the ``runs/submit`` endpoint.

   * - Parameter
     - Input
   * - spark_jar_task: dict
     - main class and parameters for the JAR task
   * - notebook_task: dict
     - notebook path and parameters for the task
   * - spark_python_task: dict
     - python file path and parameters to run the python file with
   * - spark_submit_task: dict
     - parameters needed to run a spark-submit command
   * - new_cluster: dict
     - specs for a new cluster on which this task will be run
   * - existing_cluster_id: string
     - ID for existing cluster on which to run this task
   * - libraries: list of dict
     - libraries which this run will use
   * - run_name: string
     - run name used for this task
   * - timeout_seconds: integer
     - The timeout for this run
   * - databricks_conn_id: string
     - the name of the Airflow connection to use
   * - polling_period_seconds: integer
     - controls the rate which we poll for the result of this run
   * - databricks_retry_limit: integer
     - amount of times retry if the Databricks backend is unreachable
   * - databricks_retry_delay: decimal
     - number of seconds to wait between retries
   * - do_xcom_push: boolean
     - whether we should push run_id and run_page_url to xcom

An example usage of the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator is as follows:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/databricks/example_dags/example_databricks.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_databricks_json]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_databricks_json]

You can also use named parameters to initialize the operator and run the job.

.. exampleinclude:: /../../airflow/providers/databricks/example_dags/example_databricks.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_databricks_named]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_databricks_named]
