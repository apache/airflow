This chart will bootstrap an `Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org>`__
deployment on a `Kubernetes <http://kubernetes.io>`__ cluster using the
`Helm <https://helm.sh>`__ package manager.

Requirements
------------

-  Kubernetes 1.14+ cluster
-  Helm 3.0+
-  PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure (optionally)

Features
--------

* Supported executors: ``LocalExecutor``, ``CeleryExecutor``, ``CeleryKubernetesExecutor``, ``KubernetesExecutor``.
* Supported Airflow version: ``1.10+``, ``2.0+``
* Supported database backend: ``PostgresSQL``, ``MySQL``
* Autoscaling for ``CeleryExecutor`` provided by KEDA
* PostgresSQL and PgBouncer with a battle-tested configuration
* Monitoring:

   * StatsD/Prometheus metrics for Airflow
   * Prometheus metrics for PgBouncer
   * Flower
* Automatic database migration after a new deployment
* Administrator account creation during deployment
* Kerberos secure configuration
* One-command deployment for any type of executor. You don't need to provide other services e.g. Redis/Database to test the Airflow.

Installing the Chart
--------------------

To install this chart using helm 3, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl create namespace airflow
    helm repo add apache-airflow https://airflow.apache.org
    helm install airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace airflow

The command deploys Airflow on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The :doc:`parameters-ref`
section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.


.. tip:: List all releases using ``helm list``.

Upgrading the Chart
-------------------

To upgrade the chart with the release name ``airflow``:

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace airflow

.. note::
  To upgrade to a new version of the chart, run ``helm repo update`` first.

Uninstalling the Chart
----------------------

To uninstall/delete the ``airflow`` deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    helm delete airflow --namespace airflow

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
