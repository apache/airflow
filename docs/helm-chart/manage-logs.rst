Manage logs
=================

You have a number of options when it comes to managing your Airflow logs.

No persistence
-----------------

With this option, Airflow will log locally to each pod. As such, the logs will only be available during the lifetime of the pod.

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow \
      --set logs.persistence.enabled=false
      # --set workers.persistence.enabled=false (also needed if using ``CeleryExecutor``)

Celery worker log persistence
-----------------------------

If you are using ``CeleryExecutor``, workers persist logs by default to a volume claim created with a ``volumeClaimTemplate``.

You can modify the template:

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow \
      --set executor=CeleryExecutor \
      --set workers.persistence.size=10Gi

Note with this option only task logs are persisted, unlike when log persistence is enabled which will also persist scheduler logs.

Log persistence enabled
-----------------------

This option will provision a ``PersistentVolumeClaim`` with an access mode of ``ReadWriteMany``. Each component of Airflow will
then log onto the same volume.

Not all volume plugins have support for ``ReadWriteMany`` access mode.
Refer `Persistent Volume Access Modes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes>`__
for details.

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow \
      --set logs.persistence.enabled=true
      # you can also override the other persistence
      # by setting the logs.persistence.* values
      # Please refer to values.yaml for details

Externally provisioned PVC
--------------------------

In this approach, Airflow will log to an existing ``ReadWriteMany`` PVC. You pass in the name of the volume claim to the chart.

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow \
      --set logs.persistence.enabled=true \
      --set logs.persistence.existingClaim=my-volume-claim

Note that the volume will need to writable by the Airflow user. The easiest way is to ensure GID ``0`` has write permission.
More information can be found in the :ref:`Docker image entrypoint documentation <docker-stack:arbitrary-docker-user>`.

Elasticsearch
-------------

If your cluster forwards logs to Elasticsearch, you can configure Airflow to retrieve task logs from it.
See the :doc:`Elasticsearch providers guide <apache-airflow-providers-elasticsearch:logging>` for more details.

.. code-block:: bash

    helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow \
      --set elasticsearch.enabled=true \
      --set elasticsearch.secretName=my-es-secret
      # Other choices exist. Please refer to values.yaml for details.
