Adding Connections, Variables and Environment Variables
=======================================================

You can programmatically add Connections, Variables and arbitrary Environment Variables to your
Airflow deployment using the Helm chart.


Connections and Sensitive Environment Variables
-----------------------------------------------
Under the ``secret`` and ``extraSecret`` sections of the ``values.yaml`` you can pass connection strings and sensitive
environment variables into Airflow using the Helm chart. To illustrate, lets create a yaml file called ``override.yaml``
to override values under these sections of the ``values.yaml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # override.yaml

   secret:
     - envName: "AIRFLOW_CONN_GCP"
        secretName: "my-airflow-connections"
        secretKey: "AIRFLOW_CONN_GCP"
      - envName: "my-env"
        secretName: "my-secret-name"
        secretKey: "my-secret-key"

   extraSecrets:
     my-airflow-connections:
       data: |
         AIRFLOW_CONN_GCP: 'base64_encoded_gcp_conn_string'
     my-secret-name:
       stringData: |
         my-secret-key: my-secret


Variables
---------
Airflow supports Variables which enable users to craft dynamic DAGs. You can set Variables in Airflow in three ways - UI,
command line, and within your DAG file. See :doc:`apache-airflow:howto/variable` for more.

With the Helm chart, you can also inject environment variables into Airflow. So in the example ``override.yaml`` file,
we can override values of interest in the ``env`` section of the ``values.yaml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   env:
     - name: "AIRFLOW_VAR_KEY"
       value: "value_1"
     - name: "AIRFLOW_VAR_ANOTHER_KEY"
       value: "value_2"


You can also utilize ``extraEnv`` and ``extraEnvFrom`` if you need the name or value to be templated.

.. code-block:: yaml

   extraEnv: |
     - name: AIRFLOW_VAR_HELM_RELEASE_NAME
       value: '{{ .Release.Name }}'

   extraEnvFrom: |
     - configMapRef:
         name: '{{ .Release.Name }}-airflow-variables'

   extraConfigMaps:
     '{{ .Release.Name }}-airflow-variables':
       data: |
         AIRFLOW_VAR_HELLO_MESSAGE: "Hi!"
