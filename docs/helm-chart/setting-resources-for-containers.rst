Setting resources for containers
--------------------------------

It is possible to set `resources <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/>`__ for the Containers managed by the chart. You can define different resources for various Airflow k8s Containers. By default the resources are not set.

.. note::
    The k8s scheduler can use resources to decide which node to place the Pod on. Since a Pod resource request/limit is the sum of the resource requests/limits for each Container in the Pod, it is advised to specify resources for each Container in the Pod.

Possible Containers where resources can be configured include:

* Main Airflow Containers and their sidecars. You can add the resources for these Containers through the following parameters:

   * ``workers.resources``
   * ``workers.logGroomerSidecar.resources``
   * ``workers.kerberosSidecar.resources``
   * ``scheduler.resources``
   * ``scheduler.logGroomerSidecar.resources``
   * ``dags.gitSync.resources``
   * ``webserver.resources``
   * ``flower.resources``
   * ``triggerer.resources``

* Containers used for Airflow k8s jobs or cron jobs. You can add the resources for these Containers through the following parameters:

   * ``cleanup.resources``
   * ``createUserJob.resources``
   * ``migrateDatabaseJob.resources``

* Other containers that can be deployed by the chart. You can add the resources for these Containers through the following parameters:

   * ``statsd.resources``
   * ``pgbouncer.resources``
   * ``pgbouncer.metricsExporterSidecar.resources``
   * ``redis.resources``


For example, specifying resources for worker Kerberos sidecar:

.. code-block:: yaml

  workers:
    kerberosSidecar:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 256Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
