Configuration Reference

.. jinja:: config_ctx

  This page contains the list of all available Airflow configurations for the
  ``{{ package_name }}`` provider that can be set in the ``airflow.cfg`` file or using environment variables.

  .. note::
    The configuration embedded in provider packages started to be used as of Airflow 2.7.0. Previously the
    configuration was described and configured in the Airflow core package - so if you are using Airflow
    below 2.7.0, look at Airflow documentation for the list of available configuration options
    that were available in Airflow core.

  .. note::
     For more information see :doc:`apache-airflow:howto/set-config`.
