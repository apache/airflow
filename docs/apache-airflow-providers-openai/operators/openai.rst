OpenAIEmbeddingOperator
========================

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.open_ai.operators.open_ai.OpenAIEmbeddingOperator` to
interact with Open APIs to create embeddings for given text.


Using the Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OpenAIEmbeddingOperator requires the ``input_text`` as an input to embedding API. Use the ``conn_id`` parameter to specify the OpenAI connection to use to
connect to your account.

An example using the operator is in way:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/openai/example_openai.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_openai_embedding]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_openai_embedding]
