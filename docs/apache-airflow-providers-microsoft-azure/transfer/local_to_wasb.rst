Upload data from Local Filesystem to Azure Blob Storage
=======================================================
The Blob service stores text and binary data as objects in the cloud.

Within your storage account, containers provide a way to organize sets of blobs.
For more information about the service visit `Azure Blob Storage API documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api>`_.
