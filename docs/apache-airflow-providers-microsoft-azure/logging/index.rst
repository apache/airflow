Writing logs to Azure Blob Storage
----------------------------------

Airflow can be configured to read and write task logs in Azure Blob Storage. It uses an existing
Airflow connection to read or write logs. If you don't have a connection properly setup,
this process will fail.

Follow the steps below to enable Azure Blob Storage logging:

To enable this feature, ``airflow.cfg`` must be configured as in this
example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [logging]
    # Airflow can store logs remotely in AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage or Elastic Search.
    # Users must supply an Airflow connection id that provides access to the storage
    # location. If remote_logging is set to true, see UPDATING.md for additional
    # configuration requirements.
    remote_logging = True
    remote_base_log_folder = wasb-base-folder/path/to/logs
    remote_wasb_log_container = my-container

#. Install the provider package with ``pip install apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-azure``
#. Ensure :ref:`connection <howto/connection:wasb>` is already setup with read and write access to Azure Blob Storage in the ``remote_wasb_log_container`` container and path ``remote_base_log_folder``.
#. Setup the above configuration values. Please note that the ``remote_base_log_folder`` should start with ``wasb`` to select the correct handler as shown above and the container should already exist.
#. Restart the Airflow webserver and scheduler, and trigger (or wait for) a new task execution.
#. Verify that logs are showing up for newly executed tasks in the container at the specified base path you have defined.
#. Verify that the Azure Blob Storage viewer is working in the UI. Pull up a newly executed task, and verify that you see something like:

.. code-block:: none
