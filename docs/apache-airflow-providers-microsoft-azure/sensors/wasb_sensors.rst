Azure Blob Storage
==================
The Blob service stores text and binary data as objects in the cloud.
The Blob service offers the following three resources: the storage account, containers, and blobs.
Within your storage account, containers provide a way to organize sets of blobs.
For more information about the service visit `Azure Blob Storage API documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api>`_.
This page shows how to check for blobs in a particular container.
