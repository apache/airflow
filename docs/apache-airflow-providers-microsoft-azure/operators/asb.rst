Azure Service Bus Operators
============================
Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and
publish-subscribe topics (in a namespace). Service Bus is used to decouple applications
and services from each other. Service Bus that perform operations on
entities, such as namespaces, queues, and topics.

The Service Bus REST API provides operations for working with the following resources:
  - Azure Resource Manager
  - Service Bus service
