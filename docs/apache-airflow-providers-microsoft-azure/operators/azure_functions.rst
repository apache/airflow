Azure Functions Operators
=========================
Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure,
and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides
all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running. Azure Functions allows you to implement your
system's logic into readily available blocks of code. These code blocks are called "functions".
