Azure Blob Storage Transfer Operator
====================================
The Blob service stores text and binary data as objects in the cloud.
The Blob service offers the following three resources: the storage account, containers, and blobs.
Within your storage account, containers provide a way to organize sets of blobs.
For more information about the service visit `Azure Blob Storage API documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api>`_.

Before you begin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before using Blob Storage within Airflow you need to authenticate your account with Token, Login and Password.
Please follow Azure
`instructions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal>`_
to do it.

TOKEN should be added to the Connection in Airflow in JSON format, Login and Password as plain text.
You can check `how to do such connection <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/howto/connection/index.html#editing-a-connection-with-the-ui>`_.

See following example.
Set values for these fields:

.. code-block::

  Conn Id: wasb_default
  Login: Storage Account Name
  Password: KEY1
  Extra: {"sas_token": "TOKEN"}

.. contents::
