Python API Reference
====================

.. _pythonapi:operators:

Operators
---------
Operators allow for generation of certain types of tasks that become nodes in
the DAG when instantiated. All operators derive from :class:`~airflow.models.BaseOperator` and
inherit many attributes and methods that way.

There are 3 main types of operators:

- Operators that performs an **action**, or tell another system to
  perform an action
- **Transfer** operators move data from one system to another
- **Sensors** are a certain type of operator that will keep running until a
  certain criterion is met. Examples include a specific file landing in HDFS or
  S3, a partition appearing in Hive, or a specific time of the day. Sensors
  are derived from :class:`~airflow.sensors.base_sensor_operator.BaseSensorOperator` and run a poke
  method at a specified :attr:`~airflow.sensors.base_sensor_operator.BaseSensorOperator.poke_interval` until it returns ``True``.

BaseOperator
''''''''''''
All operators are derived from :class:`~airflow.models.BaseOperator` and acquire much
functionality through inheritance. Since this is the core of the engine,
it's worth taking the time to understand the parameters of :class:`~airflow.models.BaseOperator`
to understand the primitive features that can be leveraged in your
DAGs.

BaseSensorOperator
''''''''''''''''''
All sensors are derived from :class:`~airflow.sensors.base_sensor_operator.BaseSensorOperator`. All sensors inherit
the :attr:`~airflow.sensors.base_sensor_operator.BaseSensorOperator.timeout` and :attr:`~airflow.sensors.base_sensor_operator.BaseSensorOperator.poke_interval` on top of the :class:`~airflow.models.BaseOperator`
attributes.

Operators packages
