Documentation
#############

This directory contains documentation for the Apache Airflow project and other packages that are closely related to it ie. providers packages.  Documentation is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__.

For Helm Chart, see: `/chart/README.md <../chart/READMe.md>`__

Development documentation preview
==================================

Documentation from the ``master`` branch is built and automatically published: `s.apache.org/airflow-docs <https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs>`_

Documentation for your PRs is available as downloadable artifact in GitHub Actions after the CI builds your PR.

Building documentation
======================

To generate a local version you can use `<../BREEZE.rst>`_.

The documentation build consists of verifying consistency of documentation and two steps:

* spell checking
* building documentation

You can only run one of the steps via ``--spellcheck-only`` or ``--docs-only``.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./breeze build-docs

or just to run spell-check

.. code-block:: bash

     ./breeze build-docs -- --spellcheck-only

or just to run documentation building

.. code-block:: bash

     ./breeze build-docs -- --docs-only

Running the Docs Locally
------------------------

Once you have built the documentation run the following command from the root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    docs/start_doc_server.sh

Then, view your docs at ``localhost:8000``

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are creating ``example_dags`` directory, you need to create ``example_dags/__init__.py`` with Apache
license or copy another ``__init__.py`` file that contains the necessary license.

Cross-referencing syntax
========================

Cross-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles.
Basically, you only need to write:

.. code-block:: rst

    :role:`target`

And a link will be
created to the item named *target* of the type indicated by *role*. The link's
text will be the same as *target*.

You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct
hyperlinks:

.. code-block:: rst

    :role:`title <target>`

This will refer to *target*, but the link text will be *title*.

Here are practical examples:

.. code-block:: rst

    :class:`airflow.models.dag.DAG` - link to Python API reference documentation
    :doc:`/docs/operators` - link to other document
    :ref:`handle` - link to section in current or another document

    .. _handle:

    Section title
    ----------------------------------

Role ``:class:`` works well with references between packages. If you want to use other roles, it is a good idea to specify a package:

.. code-block:: rst

    :doc:`apache-airflow:installation`
    :ref:`apache-airflow-providers-google:write-logs-stackdriver`

If you still feel confused then you can view more possible roles for our documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./list-roles.sh

For more information, see: `Cross-referencing syntax <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html>`_ in Sphinx documentation
