Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.dingding.operators.dingding.DingdingOperator`
to send message through `DingTalk Custom Robot <https://open.dingtalk.com/document/robots/custom-robot-access>`__:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/dingding/example_dingding.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding]


Remind users in message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use parameters ``at_mobiles`` and ``at_all`` to remind specific users when you send message,
``at_mobiles`` will be ignored When ``at_all`` is set to ``True``:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/dingding/example_dingding.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_remind_users]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_remind_users]


Send rich text message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~airflow.providers.dingding.operators.dingding.DingdingOperator`
can send rich text messages including link, markdown, actionCard and feedCard
through `DingTalk Custom Robot <https://open.dingtalk.com/document/robots/custom-robot-access#title-72m-8ag-pqw>`__.
A rich text message can not remind specific users except by using markdown type message:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/dingding/example_dingding.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_rich_text]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_rich_text]


Sending messages from a Task callback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:class:`~airflow.providers.dingding.hooks.dingding.DingdingHook` could handle task callback by writing a callback function
and then pass the function to ``sla_miss_callback``, ``on_success_callback``, ``on_failure_callback``,
or ``on_retry_callback``. Here we use ``on_failure_callback`` as an example:

.. exampleinclude:: /../../tests/system/providers/dingding/example_dingding.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_failure_callback]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_failure_callback]


Changing connection host if you need
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :class:`~airflow.providers.dingding.operators.dingding.DingdingOperator` operator
post http requests using default host ``https://oapi.dingtalk.com``,
if you need to change the host used you can set the host field of the connection.
