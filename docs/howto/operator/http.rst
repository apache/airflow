HTTP Operators
==============

The following code examples use the ``http_default`` connection which means the requests are sent against
`httpbin <https://www.httpbin.org/>`__ site to perform basic HTTP operations.

.. _howto/operator:HttpSensor:

HttpSensor
----------

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.http.sensors.http.HttpSensor` to poke until the ``response_check`` callable evaluates
to ``true``.

Here we are poking until httpbin gives us a response text containing ``httpbin``.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_http_sensor_check]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_http_sensor_check]

.. _howto/operator:SimpleHttpOperator:

SimpleHttpOperator
------------------

Use the :class:`~airflow.providers.http.operators.http.SimpleHttpOperator` to call HTTP requests and get
the response text back.

In the first example we are calling a ``POST`` with json data and succeed when we get the same json data back
otherwise the task will fail.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_post_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_post_op]

Here we are calling a ``GET`` request and pass params to it. The task will succeed regardless of the response text.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_get_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_get_op]

In the third example we are performing a ``PUT`` operation to put / set data according to the data that is being
provided to the request.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_put_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_put_op]

In this example we call a ``DELETE`` operation to the ``delete`` endpoint. This time we are passing form data to the
request.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_del_op]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_del_op]

Here we pass form data to a ``POST`` operation which is equal to a usual form submit.

.. exampleinclude:: /../airflow/providers/http/example_dags/example_http.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_http_task_post_op_formenc]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_http_task_post_op_formenc]
