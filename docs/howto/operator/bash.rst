.. _howto/operator:BashOperator:

BashOperator
============

Use the :class:`~airflow.operators.bash_operator.BashOperator` to execute
commands in a `Bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__ shell.

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/example_dags/example_bash_operator.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_bash]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_bash]

Templating
----------

You can use :ref:`Jinja templates <jinja-templating>` to parameterize the
``bash_command`` argument.

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/example_dags/example_bash_operator.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_bash_template]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_bash_template]

Troubleshooting
---------------

Jinja template not found
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Add a space after the script name when directly calling a Bash script with
the ``bash_command`` argument. This is because Airflow tries to apply a Jinja
template to it, which will fail.

.. code-block:: python

    t2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='bash_example',

        # This fails with `Jinja template not found` error
        # bash_command="/home/batcher/test.sh",

        # This works (has a space after)
        bash_command="/home/batcher/test.sh ",
        dag=dag)
