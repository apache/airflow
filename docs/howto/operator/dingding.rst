Dingding Operators
==================


Prerequisite Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use this operators, you must do a few things:

  * Add custom robot to Dingding group which you want to send Dingding message.
  * Get the webhook token from Dingding custom robot.
  * Put the Dingding custom robot token in the password field of the ``dingding_default``
    Connection. Notice that you just need token rather than the whole webhook string.

Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the :class:`~airflow/contrib/operators/dingding_operator.DingdingOperator`
to send Dingding message:

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/contrib/example_dags/example_dingding_operator.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding]


Remind users in message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use parameters ``at_mobiles`` and ``at_all`` to remind specific users when you send message,
``at_mobiles`` will be ignored When ``at_all`` is set to ``True``:

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/contrib/example_dags/example_dingding_operator.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_remind_users]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_remind_users]


Send rich text message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Dingding operator can send rich text messages including link, markdown, actionCard and feedCard.
A rich text message can not remind specific users except by using markdown type message:

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/contrib/example_dags/example_dingding_operator.py
    :language: python
    :dedent: 4
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_rich_text]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_rich_text]


Sending messages from a Task callback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dingding operator could handle task callback by writing a function wrapper dingding operators
and then pass the function to ``sla_miss_callback``, ``on_success_callback``, ``on_failure_callback``,
or ``on_retry_callback``. Here we use ``on_failure_callback`` as an example:

.. exampleinclude:: ../../../airflow/contrib/example_dags/example_dingding_operator.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START howto_operator_dingding_failure_callback]
    :end-before: [END howto_operator_dingding_failure_callback]


Changing connection host if you need
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Dingding operator post http requests using default host ``https://oapi.dingtalk.com``,
if you need to change the host used you can set the host field of the connection.
