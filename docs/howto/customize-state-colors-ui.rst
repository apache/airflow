Customizing state colours in UI
===============================

.. versionadded:: 1.10.11

To change the colors for TaskInstance/DagRun State in the Airflow Webserver, perform the
following steps:

1.  Create ``airflow_local_settings.py`` file and put in on ``$PYTHONPATH`` or
    to ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/config`` folder. (Airflow adds ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/config`` on ``PYTHONPATH`` when
    Airflow is initialized)

2.  Add the following contents to ``airflow_local_settings.py`` file. Change the colors to whatever you
    would like.

    .. code-block:: python

      STATE_COLORS = {
        "queued": 'darkgray',
        "running": '#01FF70',
        "success": '#2ECC40',
        "failed": 'firebrick',
        "up_for_retry": 'yellow',
        "up_for_reschedule": 'turquoise',
        "upstream_failed": 'orange',
        "skipped": 'darkorchid',
        "scheduled": 'tan',
      }



3.  Restart Airflow Webserver.
