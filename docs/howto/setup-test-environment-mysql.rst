Setup Test Environment using MySQL
==================================

By default, Airflow uses SQLite as database backend
and ``SequentialExecutor`` to execute tasks as SQLite
does not support multiple connections. Since
``SequentialExecutor`` runs one instance at a time,
some parallel execution logic will not be exercised
in this default setup.

To test out the parallel execution setup, we can use
MySQL as database backend and ``LocalExecutor`` as
the executor. Checkout the following setups to launch
a MySQL database container:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Launch MySQL docker container
  docker-compose -f scripts/ci/docker-compose.yml run -p3306:3306 mysql

  # Open airflow.cfg and add the following:
  # executor = LocalExecutor
  vim $AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg

  export AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3306/AIRFLOW_HOME

  airflow db init
