Add a new role in RBAC UI
=========================

There are five roles created for Airflow by default: Admin, User, Op, Viewer, and Public.
The master branch adds beta support for DAG level access for RBAC UI. Each DAG comes with two permissions: read and write.

The Admin could create a specific role which is only allowed to read / write certain DAGs. To configure a new role, go to ``Security`` tab
and click ``List Roles`` in the new UI.

The image shows the creation of a role which can only write to
``example_python_operator``. You can also create roles via the CLI
using the ``airflow roles`` command, e.g.:

    airflow roles --create Role1 Role2

And we could assign the given role to a new user using the ``airflow
users --add-role`` CLI command.  Default roles(Admin, User, Viewer,
Op) shipped with RBAC could view the details for every dag.
