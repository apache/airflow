Define an operator extra link
=============================

For each operator, you can define its own extra links that can
redirect users to external systems. The extra link buttons
will be available on the task page:

.. image:: ../img/operator_extra_link.png

The following code shows how to add extra links to an operator:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator, BaseOperatorLink
    from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults


    class GoogleLink(BaseOperatorLink):

        def get_link(self, operator, dttm):
            return "https://www.google.com"

    class MyFirstOperator(BaseOperator):

        operator_extra_link_dict = {
            "Google": GoogleLink(),
        }

        @apply_defaults
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super(MyFirstOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        def execute(self, context):
            self.log.info("Hello World!")

You can also add a global operator extra link that will be available to
all the operators through airflow plugin. Learn more about it in the
:ref:`plugin example <plugin-example>`.
