Kubernetes cluster Connection
=============================

The Kubernetes cluster Connection type enables connection to Kubernetes cluster.


Authenticating to Kubernetes cluster
------------------------------------

There are three ways to connect to Kubernetes using Airflow.

1. Use kube_config that reside in the default location on the machine(~/.kube/config) - just leave all fields empty
2. Use in_cluster config, if Airflow runs inside Kubernetes cluster take the configuration from the cluster - mark:
    In cluster configuration
3. Use kube_config from different location - insert the path into ``Kube config path``
4. Use kube_config in JSON format from connection configuration - paste  kube_config into
    ``Kube config (JSON format)``


Default Connection IDs
----------------------

The default connection ID is ``kubernetes_default`` .

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------


In cluster configuration
  Use in cluster configuration.

Kube config path
  Use custom path to kube config.

Kube config (JSON format)
  `Kube config <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/>`_
  that used to connect to Kubernetes client.
