MySQL Connection
================
The MySQL connection type provides connection to a MySQL database.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------
Host (required)
    The host to connect to.

Schema (optional)
    Specify the schema name to be used in the database.

Login (required)
    Specify the user name to connect.

Password (required)
    Specify the password to connect.

Extra (optional)
    Specify the extra parameters (as json dictionary) that can be used in MySQL
    connection. The following parameters are supported:

    * **charset**: specify charset of the connection
    * **cursor**: one of "sscursor", "dictcursor, "ssdictcursor" . Specifies cursor class to be
      used
    * **local_infile**: controls MySQL's LOCAL capability (permitting local data loading by
      clients). See `MySQLdb docs <https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/user_guide.html>`_
      for details.
    * **unix_socket**: UNIX socket used instead of the default socket.
    * **ssl**: Dictionary of SSL parameters that control connecting using SSL. Those
      parameters are server specific and should contain "ca", "cert", "key", "capath",
      "cipher" parameters. See
      `MySQLdb docs <https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/user_guide.html>`_ for details.
      Note that to be useful in URL notation, this parameter might also be
      a string where the SSL dictionary is a string-encoded JSON dictionary.

    Example "extras" field:

    .. code-block:: json

       {
          "charset": "utf8",
          "cursor": "sscursor",
          "local_infile": true,
          "unix_socket": "/var/socket",
          "ssl": {
            "cert": "/tmp/client-cert.pem",
            "ca": "/tmp/server-ca.pem'",
            "key": "/tmp/client-key.pem"
          }
       }

    or

    .. code-block:: json

       {
          "charset": "utf8",
          "cursor": "sscursor",
          "local_infile": true,
          "unix_socket": "/var/socket",
          "ssl": "{\"cert\": \"/tmp/client-cert.pem\", \"ca\": \"/tmp/server-ca.pem\", \"key\": \"/tmp/client-key.pem\"}"
       }

    When specifying the connection as URI (in AIRFLOW_CONN_* variable) you should specify it
    following the standard syntax of DB connections - where extras are passed as parameters
    of the URI. Note that all components of the URI should be URL-encoded.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

       mysql://mysql_user:XXXXXXXXXXXX@1.1.1.1:3306/mysqldb?ssl=%7B%22cert%22%3A+%22%2Ftmp%2Fclient-cert.pem%22%2C+%22ca%22%3A+%22%2Ftmp%2Fserver-ca.pem%22%2C+%22key%22%3A+%22%2Ftmp%2Fclient-key.pem%22%7D

    .. note::
        If encounter UnicodeDecodeError while working with MySQL connection, check
        the charset defined is matched to the database charset.
