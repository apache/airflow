Managing Connections
====================

Airflow needs to know how to connect to your environment. Information
such as hostname, port, login and passwords to other systems and services is
handled in the ``Admin->Connections`` section of the UI. The pipeline code you
will author will reference the 'conn_id' of the Connection objects.

Connections can be created and managed using either the UI or environment
variables.

See the :ref:`Connections Concepts <concepts-connections>` documentation for
more information.

Creating a Connection with the UI
---------------------------------

Open the ``Admin->Connections`` section of the UI. Click the ``Create`` link
to create a new connection.

1. Fill in the ``Conn Id`` field with the desired connection ID. It is
   recommended that you use lower-case characters and separate words with
   underscores.
2. Choose the connection type with the ``Conn Type`` field.
3. Fill in the remaining fields. See
   :ref:`manage-connections-connection-types` for a description of the fields
   belonging to the different connection types.
4. Click the ``Save`` button to create the connection.

Editing a Connection with the UI
--------------------------------

Open the ``Admin->Connections`` section of the UI. Click the pencil icon next
to the connection you wish to edit in the connection list.

Modify the connection properties and click the ``Save`` button to save your
changes.

Creating a Connection with Environment Variables
------------------------------------------------

Connections in Airflow pipelines can be created using environment variables.
The environment variable needs to have a prefix of ``AIRFLOW_CONN_`` for
Airflow with the value in a URI format to use the connection properly.

When referencing the connection in the Airflow pipeline, the ``conn_id``
should be the name of the variable without the prefix. For example, if the
``conn_id`` is named ``postgres_master`` the environment variable should be
named ``AIRFLOW_CONN_POSTGRES_MASTER`` (note that the environment variable
must be all uppercase).

Airflow assumes the value returned from the environment variable to be in a URI
format (e.g.``postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/master`` or
``s3://accesskey:secretkey@S3``). The underscore character is not allowed
in the scheme part of URI, so it must be changed to a hyphen character
(e.g. ``google-compute-platform`` if ``conn_type`` is ``google_compute_platform``).
Query parameters are parsed to one-dimensional dict and then used to fill extra.
