Creating a Connection
=====================

Connections in Airflow pipelines can be created using environment variables.
The environment variable needs to have a prefix of ``AIRFLOW_CONN_`` for
Airflow with the value in a URI format to use the connection properly. Please
see the :doc:`../../concepts` documentation for more information on environment
variables and connections.
