Managing Connections
=====================

Airflow needs to know how to connect to your environment. Information
such as hostname, port, login and passwords to other systems and services is
handled in the ``Admin->Connection`` section of the UI. The pipeline code you
will author will reference the 'conn_id' of the Connection objects.

Connections can be created and managed using either the UI or environment
variables.

See the :ref:`Connenctions Concepts <concepts-connections>` documentation for
more information.

Creating a Connection with the UI
---------------------------------

Open the ``Admin->Connection`` section of the UI. Click the ``Create`` link
to create a new connection.

.. image:: ../img/connection_create.png

1. Fill in the ``Conn Id`` field with the desired connection ID. It is
   recommended that you use lower-case characters and separate words with
   underscores.
2. Choose the connection type with the ``Conn Type`` field.
3. Fill in the remaining fields. See
   :ref:`manage-connections-connection-types` for a description of the fields
   belonging to the different connection types.
4. Click the ``Save`` button to create the connection.

Editing a Connection with the UI
--------------------------------

Open the ``Admin->Connection`` section of the UI. Click the pencil icon next
to the connection you wish to edit in the connection list.

Modify the connection properties and click the ``Save`` button to save your
changes.

Creating a Connection with Environment Variables
------------------------------------------------

Connections in Airflow pipelines can be created using environment variables.
The environment variable needs to have a prefix of ``AIRFLOW_CONN_`` for
Airflow with the value in a URI format to use the connection properly.

When referencing the connection in the Airflow pipeline, the ``conn_id``
should be the name of the variable without the prefix. For example, if the
``conn_id`` is named ``postgres_master`` the environment variable should be
named ``AIRFLOW_CONN_POSTGRES_MASTER`` (note that the environment variable
must be all uppercase). Airflow assumes the value returned from the
environment variable to be in a URI format (e.g.
``postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/master`` or
``s3://accesskey:secretkey@S3``).

Connection Types
----------------

.. _connection-type-GCP:

Google Cloud Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Google Cloud Platform connection type enables the :ref:`GCP Integrations
<GCP>`.

Authenticating to GCP
'''''''''''''''''''''

There are two ways to connect to GCP using Airflow.

1. Use `Application Default Credentials
   <https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/google.auth.html#google.auth.default>`_,
   such as via the metadata server when running on Google Compute Engine.
2. Use a `service account
   <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/#service_accounts>`_ key
   file (JSON format) on disk.

Default Connection IDs
''''''''''''''''''''''

The following connection IDs are used by default.

``bigquery_default``
    Used by the :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.bigquery_hook.BigQueryHook`
    hook.

``google_cloud_datastore_default``
    Used by the :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.datastore_hook.DatastoreHook`
    hook.

``google_cloud_default``
    Used by the
    :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.gcp_api_base_hook.GoogleCloudBaseHook`,
    :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.gcp_dataflow_hook.DataFlowHook`,
    :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.gcp_dataproc_hook.DataProcHook`,
    :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.gcp_mlengine_hook.MLEngineHook`, and
    :class:`~airflow.contrib.hooks.gcs_hook.GoogleCloudStorageHook` hooks.

Configuring the Connection
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Project Id (required)
    The Google Cloud project ID to connect to.

Keyfile Path
    Path to a `service account
    <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/#service_accounts>`_ key
    file (JSON format) on disk.

    Not required if using application default credentials.

Keyfile JSON
    Contents of a `service account
    <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/#service_accounts>`_ key
    file (JSON format) on disk. It is recommended to :doc:`Secure your connections <secure-connections>` if using this method to authenticate.

    Not required if using application default credentials.

Scopes (comma separated)
    A list of comma-separated `Google Cloud scopes
    <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes>`_ to
    authenticate with.

    .. note::
        Scopes are ignored when using application default credentials. See
        issue `AIRFLOW-2522
        <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2522>`_.
