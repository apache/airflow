Checking Airflow Health Status
==============================

To check the health status of your Airflow instance, you can simply access the endpoint
``/health``. It will return a JSON object in which a high-level glance is provided.

.. code-block:: JSON

  {
    "metadatabase":{
      "status":"healthy"
    },
    "scheduler":{
      "status":"healthy",
      "latest_scheduler_heartbeat":"2018-12-26 17:15:11+00:00"
    }
  }

* The ``status`` of each component can be either "healthy" or "unhealthy"

  * The status of ``metadatabase`` depends on whether a valid connection can be initiated with the database

  * The status of ``scheduler`` depends on when the latest scheduler heartbeat was received

    * If the last heartbeat was received more than 30 seconds (default value) earlier than the current time, the scheduler is
      considered unhealthy
    * This threshold value can be specified using the option ``scheduler_health_check_threshold`` within the
      ``[scheduler]`` section in ``airflow.cfg``

Please keep in mind that the HTTP response code of ``/health`` endpoint **should not** be used to determine the health
status of the application. The return code is only indicative of the state of the rest call (200 for success).
