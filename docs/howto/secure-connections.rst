Securing Connections
====================

By default, Airflow will save the passwords for the connection in plain text
within the metadata database. The ``crypto`` package is highly recommended
during installation. The ``crypto`` package does require that your operating
system have libffi-dev installed.

If ``crypto`` package was not installed initially, you can still enable encryption for
connections by following steps below:

1. Install crypto package ``pip install apache-airflow[crypto]``
2. Generate fernet_key, using this code snippet below. fernet_key must be a base64-encoded 32-byte key.

.. code:: python

    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    fernet_key= Fernet.generate_key()
    print(fernet_key) # your fernet_key, keep it in secured place!

3. Replace ``airflow.cfg`` fernet_key value with the one from step 2.
Alternatively, you can store your fernet_key in OS environment variable. You
do not need to change ``airflow.cfg`` in this case as Airflow will use environment
variable over the value in ``airflow.cfg``:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Note the double underscores
  EXPORT AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY = your_fernet_key

4. Restart Airflow webserver.
5. For existing connections (the ones that you had defined before installing ``airflow[crypto]`` and creating a Fernet key), you need to open each connection in the connection admin UI, re-type the password, and save it.
