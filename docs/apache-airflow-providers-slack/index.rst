Package apache-airflow-providers-slack
------------------------------------------------------

`Slack <https://slack.com/>`__


Release: 3.0.0

Provider package
----------------

This is a provider package for ``slack`` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in ``airflow.providers.slack`` python package.

Installation
------------

.. note::

    On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
    does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might lead to errors in installation - depends on your choice
    of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
    ``pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4`` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
    ``--use-deprecated legacy-resolver`` to your pip install command.


You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
``pip install apache-airflow-providers-slack``

PIP requirements

this doesn't mean any breaking changes to the DAG files, but if you used this library directly
then you have to make the changes. For details, see
