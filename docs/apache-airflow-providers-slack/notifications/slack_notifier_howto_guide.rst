How-to Guide for Slack notifications
====================================

Introduction
------------
Slack notifier (:class:`airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack.SlackNotifier`) allows users to send
messages to a slack channel using the various ``on_*_callbacks`` at both the DAG level and Task level

You can also use a notifier with ``sla_miss_callback``.

.. note::
    When notifiers are used with `sla_miss_callback` the context will contain only values passed to the callback, refer :ref:`sla_miss_callback<concepts:sla_miss_callback>`.

Example Code:
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
    from airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack import send_slack_notification

    with DAG(
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
        on_success_callback=[
            send_slack_notification(
                text="The DAG {{ dag.dag_id }} succeeded",
                channel="#general",
                username="Airflow",
            )
        ],
    ):
        BashOperator(
            task_id="mytask",
            on_failure_callback=[
                send_slack_notification(
                    text="The task {{ ti.task_id }} failed",
                    channel="#general",
                    username="Airflow",
                )
            ],
            bash_command="fail",
        )
