How-to Guide for Slack Operators
================================

Introduction
------------

Slack operators can send text messages (:class:`~airflow.providers.slack.operators.slack.SlackAPIFileOperator`)
or files (:class:`~airflow.providers.slack.operators.slack.SlackAPIPostOperator`) to specified Slack channels.
Provide either ``slack_conn_id`` or ``token`` for the connection, and specify ``channel`` (name or ID).

Example Code for Sending Files
------------------------------

The example below demonstrates how to send files to a Slack channel by both specifying file names as well as
directly providing file contents. Note that the ``slack_conn_id``, ``channel``, and ``initial_comment`` values
for the operators are specified as ``default_args`` of the DAG.
