# fetch the tarball and untar the source

# [optional] run Apache RAT (release audit tool) to validate license headers
# RAT docs here: https://creadur.apache.org/rat/
java -jar apache-rat.jar -E ./.rat-excludes -d .

# [optional] by default one of Apache Airflow's dependencies pulls in a GPL
# library. If this is a concern issue (also every upgrade):
# export SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes
