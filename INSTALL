# INSTALL / BUILD instructions for Apache Airflow

This is a generic installation method that requires a number of dependencies to be installed.

Depending on your system you might need different prerequisites, but the following
systems/prerequisites are known to work:

Linux (Debian Bullseye and Linux Mint Debbie):

sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libsqlite3-dev openssl \
                 sqlite default-libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlclient-dev postgresql

On Ubuntu 20.04 you may get an error of mariadb_config not found
and mysql_config not found.

Install MariaDB development headers:
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev libmariadbclient-dev

MacOS (Mojave/Catalina):

brew install sqlite mysql postgresql

# [required] fetch the tarball and untar the source move into the directory that was untarred.

# [optional] run Apache RAT (release audit tool) to validate license headers
# RAT docs here: https://creadur.apache.org/rat/. Requires Java and Apache Rat
java -jar apache-rat.jar -E ./.rat-excludes -d .

# [optional] Airflow pulls in quite a lot of dependencies in order
# to connect to other services. You might want to test or run Airflow
# from a virtual env to make sure those dependencies are separated
# from your system wide versions

python3 -m venv PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV
source PATH_TO_YOUR_VENV/bin/activate

# [required] building and installing by pip (preferred)
pip install .

# or directly
python setup.py install

# You can also install recommended version of the dependencies by using
# constraint-python<PYTHON_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION>.txt files as constraint file. This is needed in case
# you have problems with installing the current requirements from PyPI.
# There are different constraint files for different python versions. For example"

pip install . \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.7.txt"


By default `pip install` in Airflow 2.0 installs only the provider packages that are needed by the extras and
install them as packages from PyPI rather than from local sources:

pip install .[google,amazon] \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.7.txt"


You can upgrade just airflow, without paying attention to provider's dependencies by using 'constraints-no-providers'
constraint files. This allows you to keep installed provider packages.

pip install . --upgrade \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-no-providers-3.7.txt"


You can also install airflow in "editable mode" (with -e) flag and then provider packages are
available directly from the sources (and the provider packages installed from PyPI are UNINSTALLED in
order to avoid having providers in two places. And `provider.yaml` files are used to discover capabilities
of the providers which are part of the airflow source code.

You can read more about `provider.yaml` and community-managed providers in
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html for developing custom providers
and in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` for developing community maintained providers.

This is useful if you want to develop providers:

pip install -e . \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.7.txt"

You can also skip installing provider packages from PyPI by setting INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCE to "true".
In this case Airflow will be installed in non-editable mode with all providers installed from the sources.
Additionally `provider.yaml` files will also be copied to providers folders which will make the providers
discoverable by Airflow even if they are not installed from packages in this case.

INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES="true" pip install . \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.7.txt"

Airflow can be installed with extras to install some additional features (for example 'async' or 'doc' or
to install automatically providers and all dependencies needed by that provider:

pip install .[async,google,amazon] \
  --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.7.txt"
