# ðŸš§ Apache Airflow Go Task SDK ðŸš§

> [!NOTE]
> This Golang SDK is under active development and is not ready for prime-time yet.

This README is primarily aimed at developers working _on_ the Go-SDK itself. Users wishing to write Airflow tasks in Go should look at the reference docs, but those don't exist yet.

## How It Works

The Go SDK uses the Task Execution Interface (TEI or Task API) introduced in AIP-72 with Airflow 3.0.0.

The Task API however does not provide a means to get the `ExecuteTaskWorkload` to the go worker itself. For the short term, we make use of [gopher-celery](github.com/marselester/gopher-celery) to get tasks from a Redis broker. Longer term we will likely need to stabilize the Edge Executor API and write a go client for that.

Since Go is a compiled language (putting aside projects such as [YAEGI](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) that allow go to be interpreted) all tasks must be a) compiled in to the binary, and b) "registered" inside the worker process in order to be executed.

## Current state

This SDK currently will:

- Get tasks from Celery queue(s)
- Run registered tasks (no support for dag versioning or loading of multiple different "bundles")
- Heartbeat and report the final state of the final TI
- Allow access to Variables

## Known missing features

A non-exhaustive list of features we have yet to implement

- Reading of Airflow Connections
- Support for putting tasks into state other than success or failed/up-for-retry (deferred, failed-without-retries etc.)
- HTTP Log server to view logs from in-progress tasks
- Remote task logs (i.e. S3/GCS etc)
- XCom reading/writing from API server
- XCom reading/writing from other XCom backends


## Future Direction

This is more of an "it would be nice to have" than any plan or commitment, and a place to record ideas.

- Support multiple versions by compiling tasks/bundles into plugins and make use of [go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) (This is how Terraform providers work)

  This would enable use to have executor code and task code in separate processes, and to be able to have a single worker execute different bundles/versions of tasks (i.e. we'd have a go executor process that launches versioned plugin bundles to actually execute the task)
