NOTE! The files in this folder are generated by pre-commit based on airflow sources. They are not
supposed to be manually modified.

You can read more about pre-commit hooks [here](../STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#pre-commit-hooks).

* `provider_dependencies.json` - is generated based on `provider.yaml` files in `airflow/providers` and
  based on the imports in the provider code. If you want to add new dependency to a provider, you
  need to modify the corresponding `provider.yaml` file

* `provider_metadata.json` - is generated based on `provider.yaml` files, airflow constraints and tags for
  the providers. It contains historical metadata in providers that were released - it is useful to generate
  information in release notes and it is used to generate SBOM information for the providers. It is manually
  regenerated using `breeze release-management generate-providers-metadata` command."

* `PYPI_README.md` - is generated from the comprehensive `README.md` of the project, which contains exhaustive
  project details. Unlike the full `README.md`, `PYPI_README.md` is a distilled version tailored for PyPI,
  focusing on select sections. This subset is produced by the `generate-pypi-readme` pre-commit hook specified in
  the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. This hook triggers automatically whenever the related sections in the
  `README.md` change, ensuring alignment between the two files.
