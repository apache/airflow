Prerequisites
-------------

Airflow CTL is tested with:


The minimum memory required we recommend Airflow CTL to run with is 4GB, but the actual requirements depend
wildly on the deployment options you have.
The Keyring backend needs to be installed separately into your operating system. This will enhance security. See :doc:`/security` for more information.

Keyring Backend
'''''''''''''''
Airflow CTL uses keyring to store the API token securely. This ensures that the token is not stored in plain text and is only accessible to authorized users.

Recommended keyring backends are:
* `macOS Keychain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28software%29>`_
* `Freedesktop Secret Service <http://standards.freedesktop.org/secret-service/>`_ supports many DE including GNOME (requires `secretstorage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secretstorage>`_)
* `KDE4 & KDE5 KWallet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>`_ (requires `dbus <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbus-python>`_)
* `Windows Credential Locker <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/credential-locker>`_

Third-Party Backends
====================

In addition to the backends provided by the core keyring package for
the most common and secure use cases, there
are additional keyring backend implementations available for other
use cases. Simply install them to make them available:

- `keyrings.cryptfile <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.cryptfile>`_
    - Encrypted text file storage.
- `keyrings.alt <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.alt>`_
    - "alternate", possibly-insecure backends, originally part of the core package, but available for opt-in.
- `gsheet-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/gsheet-keyring>`_
    - a backend that stores secrets in a Google Sheet. For use with `ipython-secrets <https://pypi.org/project/ipython-secrets>`_.
- `bitwarden-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/bitwarden-keyring/>`_
    - a backend that stores secrets in the `BitWarden <https://bitwarden.com/>`_ password manager.
- `onepassword-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/onepassword-keyring/>`_
    - a backend that stores secrets in the `1Password <https://1password.com/>`_ password manager.
- `sagecipher <https://pypi.org/project/sagecipher>`_
    - an encryption backend which uses the ssh agent protocol's signature operation to derive the cipher key.
- `keyrings.osx_keychain_keys <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.osx-keychain-keys>`_
    - ``OSX keychain key-management``, for private, public, and symmetric keys.
- `keyring_pass.PasswordStoreBackend <https://github.com/nazarewk/keyring_pass>`_
    - Password Store (pass) backend for python's keyring
- `keyring_jeepney <https://pypi.org/project/keyring_jeepney>`__
    - a pure Python backend using the secret service ``DBus`` API for desktop Linux (requires ``keyring<24``).
