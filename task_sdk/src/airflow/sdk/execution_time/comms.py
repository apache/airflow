Communication protocol between the Supervisor and the task process
==================================================================

* All communication is done over stdout/stdin in the form of "JSON lines" (each
  message is a single JSON document terminated by `\n` character)
* Messages from the subprocess are all log messages and are sent directly to the log
* No messages are sent to task process except in response to a request. (This is because the task process will
  be running user's code, so we can't read from stdin until we enter our code, such as when requesting an XCom
  value etc.)

The reason this communication protocol exists, rather than the task process speaking directly to the Task
Execution API server is because:

1. To reduce the number of concurrent HTTP connections on the API server.

   The supervisor already has to speak to that to heartbeat the running Task, so having the task speak to its
   parent process and having all API traffic go through that means that the number of HTTP connections is
   "halved". (Not every task will make API calls, so it's not always halved, but it is reduced.)

2. This means that the user Task code doesn't ever directly see the task identity JWT token.

   This is a short lived token tied to one specific task instance try, so it being leaked/exfiltrated is not a
   large risk, but it's easy to not give it to the user code, so lets do that.
