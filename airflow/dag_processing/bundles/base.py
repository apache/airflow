    Base class for DAG bundles.

    DAG bundles are used both by the DAG processor and by a worker when running a task. These usage
    patterns are different, however.

    When running a task, we know what version of the bundle we need (assuming the bundle supports versioning).
    And we likely only need to keep this specific bundle version around for as long as we have tasks running using
    that bundle version. This also means, that on a single worker, it's possible that multiple versions of the same
    bundle are used at the same time.

    In contrast, the DAG processor uses a bundle to keep the DAGs from that bundle up to date. There will not be
    multiple versions of the same bundle in use at the same time. The DAG processor will always use the latest version.
