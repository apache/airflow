.. note::
  This release dropped support for Python 3.7

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver parameter has to be passed via keyword ``driver`` argument when initializing the Hook or via
``hook_params`` dictionary (with ``driver`` key) when instantiating Hook from SQL Operators. It was possible
to instantiate it via extras before, but in this version, only setting it via constructor is supported.

.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.

* ``OdbcHook returns None. Related to #15016 issue. (#15510)``

  When you pass kwargs to the connection (for example ``autocommit`` and ``ansi``) in ``connect_kwargs``
  extra you should bass those as booleans. Previously strings were also supported.

.. code-block:: json

   "connect_kwargs": {
      "autocommit": "false",
      "ansi": "true"
   }

should become

.. code-block:: json

   "connect_kwargs": {
      "autocommit": false,
      "ansi": true
   }
