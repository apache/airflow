Changelog
---------

2.0.0
.....

.. note::
  This release of provider is only available for Airflow 2.7+ as explained in the
  `Apache Airflow providers support policy <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst#minimum-supported-version-of-airflow-for-community-managed-providers>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   This release of provider has breaking changes from previous versions. Changes are based on
   the migration guide from pinecone - <https://canyon-quilt-082.notion.site/Pinecone-Python-SDK-v3-0-0-Migration-Guide-056d3897d7634bf7be399676a4757c7b>

* ``log_level`` field is removed from the Connections as it is not used by the provider anymore.
* ``PineconeHook.get_conn`` is removed in favor of ``conn`` property which returns the Connection object. Use ``pinecone_client`` property to access the Pinecone client.
*  Following ``PineconeHook`` methods are converted from static methods to instance methods. Hence, Initialization is required to use these now:

   + ``PineconeHook.list_indexes``
   + ``PineconeHook.upsert``
   + ``PineconeHook.create_index``
   + ``PineconeHook.describe_index``
   + ``PineconeHook.delete_index``
   + ``PineconeHook.configure_index``
   + ``PineconeHook.create_collection``
   + ``PineconeHook.delete_collection``
   + ``PineconeHook.describe_collection``
   + ``PineconeHook.list_collections``
   + ``PineconeHook.query_vector``
   + ``PineconeHook.describe_index_stats``

* ``PineconeHook.create_index`` is updated to accept a ``ServerlessSpec`` or ``PodSpec`` instead of directly accepting index related configurations
* To initialize ``PineconeHook`` object, API key needs to be passed via argument or the connection.

* ``Pinecone provider support for 'pinecone-client'>=3  (#37307)``
