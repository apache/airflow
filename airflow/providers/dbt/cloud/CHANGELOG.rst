Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with version 2.0.0, users could specify single-tenant dbt Cloud domains via the ``schema`` parameter
in an Airflow connection. Subsequently in version 2.3.1, users could also connect to the dbt Cloud instances
outside of the US region as well as private instances by using the ``host`` parameter of their Airflow
connection to specify the entire tenant domain. Backwards compatibility for using ``schema`` was left in
place. Version 3.0.0 removes support for using ``schema`` to specify the tenant domain of a dbt Cloud
instance. If you wish to connect to a single-tenant, instance outside of the US, or a private instance, you
must use the ``host`` parameter to specify the _entire_ tenant domain name in your Airflow connection.
