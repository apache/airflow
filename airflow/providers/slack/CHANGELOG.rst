We updated the support for ``slack_sdk`` from ``>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`` to ``>=3.0.0,<4.0.0``. In most cases,
this doesn't mean any breaking changes to the DAG files, but if you used this library directly
then you have to make the changes. For details, see
`the Migration Guide <https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/v3-migration/index.html#from-slackclient-2-x>`_
for Python Slack SDK.
