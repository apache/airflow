Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.

2.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We updated the support for ``slack_sdk`` from ``>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`` to ``>=3.0.0,<4.0.0``. In most cases,
this doesn't mean any breaking changes to the DAG files, but if you used this library directly
then you have to make the changes. For details, see
`the Migration Guide <https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/v3-migration/index.html#from-slackclient-2-x>`_
for Python Slack SDK.

* ``Upgrade slack_sdk to v3 (#13745)``

Initial version of the provider.
