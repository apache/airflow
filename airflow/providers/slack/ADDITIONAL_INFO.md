# Migration Guide

## 2.0.0

We updated the support for `slack_sdk` from ``>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`` to ``>=3.0.0,<4.0.0``. In most cases, this doesn't mean any breaking changes to the DAG files, but if you used this library directly then you have to make the changes.
For details, see [the Migration Guide](https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/v3-migration/index.html#from-slackclient-2-x) for Python Slack SDK.
