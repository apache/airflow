Changelog
---------

8.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of Kube API exceeded quota errors, we have introduced the ``task_publish_max_retries``
flag to control the re-queuing task behavior. Changed the default behavior from unlimited
retries to 0. The default behavior is no retries (``task_publish_max_retries==0``). For
unlimited retries, set ``task_publish_max_retries=-1``. For a fixed number of retries, set
``task_publish_max_retries`` to any positive integer.

5.0.0
.....

.. note::
  This release of provider is only available for Airflow 2.3+ as explained in the
  `Apache Airflow providers support policy <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst#minimum-supported-version-of-airflow-for-community-managed-providers>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously KubernetesPodOperator considered some settings from the Airflow config's ``kubernetes`` section.
Such consideration was deprecated in 4.1.0 and is now removed.  If you previously relied on the Airflow
config, and you want client generation to have non-default configuration, you will need to define your
configuration in an Airflow connection and set KPO to use the connection.  See kubernetes provider
documentation on defining a kubernetes Airflow connection for details.

Drop support for providing ``resource`` as dict in ``KubernetesPodOperator``. You
should use ``container_resources`` with ``V1ResourceRequirements``.

Param ``node_selectors`` has been removed in ``KubernetesPodOperator``; use ``node_selector`` instead.

The following backcompat modules for KubernetesPodOperator are removed and you must now use
the corresponding objects from the kubernetes library:

* ``airflow.kubernetes.backcompat.pod``
* ``airflow.kubernetes.backcompat.pod_runtime_info_env``
* ``airflow.kubernetes.backcompat.volume``
* ``airflow.kubernetes.backcompat.volume_mount``

* ``Remove deprecated backcompat objects for KPO (#27518)``
* ``Remove support for node_selectors param in KPO (#27515)``
* ``Remove unused backcompat method in k8s hook (#27490)``
* ``Drop support for providing ''resource'' as dict in ''KubernetesPodOperator'' (#27197)``
* ``Don't consider airflow core conf for KPO (#26849)``

Misc
~~~~

* ``Move min airflow version to 2.3.0 for all providers (#27196)``
* ``Use log.exception where more economical than log.error (#27517)``

Features
~~~~~~~~

KubernetesPodOperator argument ``name`` is now optional. Previously, ``name`` was a
required argument for KubernetesPodOperator when also not supplying pod
template or full pod spec. Now, if ``name`` is not supplied, ``task_id`` will be used.

KubernetesPodOperator argument ``namespace`` is now optional.  If not supplied via KPO param or pod
template file or full pod spec, then we'll check the airflow conn,
then if in a k8s pod, try to infer the namespace from the container, then finally
will use the ``default`` namespace.

When using an Airflow connection of type ``kubernetes``, if defining the connection in an env var
or secrets backend, it's no longer necessary to prefix the "extra" fields with ``extra__kubernetes__``.
If ``extra`` contains duplicate fields (one with prefix, one without) then the non-prefixed
one will be used.

* ``Remove extra__kubernetes__ prefix from k8s hook extras (#27021)``
* ``Add container_resources as KubernetesPodOperator templatable (#27457)``
* ``add container_name option for SparkKubernetesSensor (#26560)``
* ``Allow xcom sidecar container image to be configurable in KPO (#26766)``
* ``Improve task_id to pod name conversion (#27524)``
* ``Make pod name optional in KubernetesPodOperator (#27120)``
* ``Make namespace optional for KPO (#27116)``
* ``Enable template rendering for env_vars field for the @task.kubernetes decorator (#27433)``

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``Fix KubernetesHook fail on an attribute absence (#25787)``
* ``Fix log message for kubernetes hooks (#26999)``
* ``KPO should use hook's get namespace method to get namespace (#27516)``

.. Below changes are excluded from the changelog. Move them to
   appropriate section above if needed. Do not delete the lines(!):
  * ``Update old style typing (#26872)``
  * ``Enable string normalization in python formatting - providers (#27205)``
  * ``Update docs for September Provider's release (#26731)``

New deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* In ``KubernetesHook.get_namespace``, if a connection is defined but a namespace isn't set, we

.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider in version 4.0.0 only works with Airflow 2.3+. Please upgrade
Airflow to 2.3 version if you want to use the features or fixes in 4.* line
of the provider.

The main reason for the incompatibility is using latest Kubernetes Libraries.
The ``cncf.kubernetes`` provider requires newer version of libraries than
Airflow 2.1 and 2.2 used for Kubernetes Executor and that makes the provider
incompatible with those Airflow versions.

Parameter is_delete_operator_pod has new default
````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, the default for param ``is_delete_operator_pod`` was ``False``, which means that
after a task runs, its pod is not deleted by the operator and remains on the
cluster indefinitely.  With this release, we change the default to ``True``.

Notes on changes KubernetesPodOperator and PodLauncher
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. warning:: Many methods in ``KubernetesPodOperator`` and ``PodLauncher`` have been renamed.
    If you have subclassed ``KubernetesPodOperator`` you will need to update your subclass to reflect
    the new structure. Additionally ``PodStatus`` enum has been renamed to ``PodPhase``.

Overview
''''''''

Generally speaking if you did not subclass ``KubernetesPodOperator`` and you did not use the ``PodLauncher`` class directly,
then you don't need to worry about this change.  If however you have subclassed ``KubernetesPodOperator``, what
follows are some notes on the changes in this release.

One of the principal goals of the refactor is to clearly separate the "get or create pod" and
"wait for pod completion" phases.  Previously the "wait for pod completion" logic would be invoked
differently depending on whether the operator were to  "attach to an existing pod" (e.g. after a
worker failure) or "create a new pod" and this resulted in some code duplication and a bit more
nesting of logic.  With this refactor we encapsulate  the "get or create" step
into method ``KubernetesPodOperator.get_or_create_pod``, and pull the monitoring and XCom logic up
into the top level of ``execute`` because it can be the same for "attached" pods and "new" pods.

The ``KubernetesPodOperator.get_or_create_pod`` tries first to find an existing pod using labels
specific to the task instance (see ``KubernetesPodOperator.find_pod``).
If one does not exist it ``creates a pod <~.PodManager.create_pod>``.

The "waiting" part of execution has three components.  The first step is to wait for the pod to leave the
``Pending`` phase (``~.KubernetesPodOperator.await_pod_start``). Next, if configured to do so,
the operator will follow the base container logs and forward these logs to the task logger until
the ``base`` container is done. If not configured to harvest the
logs, the operator will instead ``KubernetesPodOperator.await_container_completion``
either way, we must await container completion before harvesting xcom. After (optionally) extracting the xcom
value from the base container, we ``await pod completion <~.PodManager.await_pod_completion>``.

Previously, depending on whether the pod was "reattached to" (e.g. after a worker failure) or
created anew, the waiting logic may have occurred in either ``handle_pod_overlap`` or ``create_new_pod_for_operator``.

After the pod terminates, we execute different cleanup tasks depending on whether the pod terminated successfully.

If the pod terminates *unsuccessfully*, we attempt to log the pod events ``PodLauncher.read_pod_events>``. If
additionally the task is configured *not* to delete the pod after termination, we apply a label ``KubernetesPodOperator.patch_already_checked>``
indicating that the pod failed and should not be "reattached to" in a retry.  If the task is configured
to delete its pod, we delete it ``KubernetesPodOperator.process_pod_deletion>``.  Finally,
we raise an AirflowException to fail the task instance.

If the pod terminates successfully, we delete the pod ``KubernetesPodOperator.process_pod_deletion>``
(if configured to delete the pod) and push XCom (if configured to push XCom).

Details on method renames, refactors, and deletions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In ``KubernetesPodOperator``:

* Method ``create_pod_launcher`` is converted to cached property ``pod_manager``
* Construction of k8s ``CoreV1Api`` client is now encapsulated within cached property ``client``
* Logic to search for an existing pod (e.g. after an airflow worker failure) is moved out of ``execute`` and into method ``find_pod``.
* Method ``handle_pod_overlap`` is removed. Previously it monitored a "found" pod until completion.  With this change the pod monitoring (and log following) is orchestrated directly from ``execute`` and it is the same  whether it's a "found" pod or a "new" pod. See methods ``await_pod_start``, ``follow_container_logs``, ``await_container_completion`` and ``await_pod_completion``.
* Method ``create_pod_request_obj`` is renamed ``build_pod_request_obj``.  It now takes argument ``context`` in order to add TI-specific pod labels; previously they were added after return.
* Method ``create_labels_for_pod`` is renamed ``_get_ti_pod_labels``.  This method doesn't return *all* labels, but only those specific to the TI. We also add parameter ``include_try_number`` to control the inclusion of this label instead of possibly filtering it out later.
* Method ``_get_pod_identifying_label_string`` is renamed ``_build_find_pod_label_selector``
* Method ``_try_numbers_match`` is removed.
* Method ``create_new_pod_for_operator`` is removed. Previously it would mutate the labels on ``self.pod``, launch the pod, monitor the pod to completion etc.  Now this logic is in part handled by ``get_or_create_pod``, where a new pod will be created if necessary. The monitoring etc is now orchestrated directly from ``execute``.  Again, see the calls to methods ``await_pod_start``, ``follow_container_logs``, ``await_container_completion`` and ``await_pod_completion``.

In class ``PodManager`` (formerly ``PodLauncher``):

* Method ``start_pod`` is removed and split into two methods: ``create_pod`` and ``await_pod_start``.
* Method ``monitor_pod`` is removed and split into methods ``follow_container_logs``, ``await_container_completion``, ``await_pod_completion``
* Methods ``pod_not_started``, ``pod_is_running``, ``process_status``, and ``_task_status`` are removed.  These were needed due to the way in which pod ``phase`` was mapped to task instance states; but we no longer do such a mapping and instead deal with pod phases directly and untransformed.
* Method ``_extract_xcom`` is renamed  ``extract_xcom``.
* Method ``read_pod_logs`` now takes kwarg ``container_name``


Other changes in ``pod_manager.py`` (formerly ``pod_launcher.py``):

* Class ``pod_launcher.PodLauncher`` renamed to ``pod_manager.PodManager``
* Enum-like class ``PodStatus`` is renamed ``PodPhase``, and the values are no longer lower-cased.
* The ``airflow.settings.pod_mutation_hook`` is no longer called in
  ``cncf.kubernetes.utils.pod_manager.PodManager.run_pod_async``. For ``KubernetesPodOperator``,
  mutation now occurs in ``build_pod_request_obj``.
* Parameter ``is_delete_operator_pod`` default is changed to ``True`` so that pods are deleted after task
  completion and not left to accumulate. In practice it seems more common to disable pod deletion only on a
  temporary basis for debugging purposes and therefore pod deletion is the more sensible default.
