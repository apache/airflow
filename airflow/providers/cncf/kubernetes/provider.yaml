  # The Kubernetes API is known to introduce problems when upgraded to a MAJOR version. Airflow Core
  # Uses Kubernetes for Kubernetes executor, and we also know that Kubernetes Python client follows SemVer
  # (https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility). This is a crucial component of Airflow
  # So we should limit it to the next MAJOR version and only deliberately bump the version when we
  # tested it, and we know it can be bumped. Bumping this version should also be connected with
  # limiting minimum airflow version supported in cncf.kubernetes provider, due to the
  # potential breaking changes in Airflow Core as well (kubernetes is added as extra, so Airflow
  # core is not hard-limited via install-requirements, only by extra).
  - kubernetes>=21.7.0,<24
  # The Kubernetes_asyncio package is used for providing Asynchronous (AsyncIO) client library for
  # standard Kubernetes API. The version is limited by minimum 18.20.1 because of introducing the ability to
  # load kubernetes config file from dictionary in that release and is limited to the next MAJOR version
  # (started from current 24.2.2 version) to prevent introducing some problems that could be due to some
  #  major changes in the package.
  - kubernetes_asyncio>=18.20.1,<25
