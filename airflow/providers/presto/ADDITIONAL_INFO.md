## Release 2021.3.3

### Bug fixes

* `Corrections in docs and tools after releasing provider RCs (#14082)`

## Additional limitations

The presto provider might not work correctly with Kerberos + SSL when it is installed together with the
Snowflake provider. It's because of Snowflake monkeypatching the urllib3
library as described in [this issue](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/issues/324)
the offending code is [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/133d6215f7920d304c5f2d466bae38127c1b836d/src/snowflake/connector/network.py#L89-L92)

In the future Snowflake plans to get rid of the monkeypatching.

You can keep track of [the issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12881) in order to know when the
issue will be resolved.
