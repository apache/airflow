    options:
      ssl_context:
        description: |
          ssl context to use when using SMTP and IMAP SSL connections. By default, the context is "default"
          which sets it to ``ssl.create_default_context()`` which provides the right balance between
          compatibility and security, it however requires that certificates in your operating system are
          updated and that SMTP/IMAP servers of yours have valid certificates that have corresponding public
          keys installed on your machines. You can switch it to "none" if you want to disable checking
          of the certificates, but it is not recommended as it allows MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks
          if your infrastructure is not sufficiently secured. It should only be set temporarily while you
          are fixing your certificate configuration. This can be typically done by upgrading to newer
          version of the operating system you run Airflow components on,by upgrading/refreshing proper
          certificates in the OS or by updating certificates for your mail servers.
          If you do not set this option explicitly, it will use Airflow "email.ssl_context" configuration,
          but if this configuration is not present, it will use "default" value.
