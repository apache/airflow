3.3.0
.....

In case of IMAP SSL connection, the context now uses the "default" context

The "default" context is Python's ``default_ssl_context`` instead of previously used "none". The
``default_ssl_context`` provides a balance between security and compatibility but in some cases,
when certificates are old, self-signed or misconfigured, it might not work. This can be configured
by setting "ssl_context" in "imap" configuration of the provider. If it is not explicitly set,
it will default to "email", "ssl_context" setting in Airflow.

Setting it to "none" brings back the "none" setting that was used in previous versions of the provider,
but it is not recommended due to security reasons and this setting disables validation
of certificates and allows MITM attacks.

You can also override "ssl_context" per-connection by setting "ssl_context" in the connection extra.

* ``Allows to choose SSL context for IMAP provider (#33108)``
* ``Add possibility to use 'ssl_context' extra for SMTP and IMAP connections (#33112)``
