class S3DeleteObjectsOperator(BaseOperator):
    """
    To enable users to delete single object or multiple objects from
    a bucket using a single HTTP request.

    Users may specify up to 1000 keys to delete.

    :param bucket: Name of the bucket in which you are going to delete object(s). (templated)
    :type bucket: str
    :param keys: The key(s) to delete from S3 bucket. (templated)

        When ``keys`` is a string, it's supposed to be the key name of
        the single object to delete.

        When ``keys`` is a list, it's supposed to be the list of the
        keys to delete.

        You may specify up to 1000 keys.
    :type keys: str or list
    :param prefix: Prefix of objects to delete. (templated)
        All objects matching this prefix in the bucket will be deleted.
    :type prefix: str
    :param aws_conn_id: Connection id of the S3 connection to use
    :type aws_conn_id: str
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.

        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used,
                 but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
