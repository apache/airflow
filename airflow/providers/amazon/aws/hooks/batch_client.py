    :param status_retries: number of HTTP retries to get job status, 10;
        polling is only used when waiters is None

    .. note::
        Several methods use a default random delay to check or poll for job status, i.e.
        ``random.uniform(DEFAULT_DELAY_MIN, DEFAULT_DELAY_MAX)``
        Using a random interval helps to avoid AWS API throttle limits
        when many concurrent tasks request job-descriptions.

        To modify the global defaults for the range of jitter allowed when a
        random delay is used to check Batch job status, modify these defaults, e.g.:
        .. code-block::

            BatchClient.DEFAULT_DELAY_MIN = 0
            BatchClient.DEFAULT_DELAY_MAX = 5

        When explicit delay values are used, a 1 second random jitter is applied to the
        delay (e.g. a delay of 0 sec will be a ``random.uniform(0, 1)`` delay.  It is
        generally recommended that random jitter is added to API requests.  A
        convenience method is provided for this, e.g. to get a random delay of
        10 sec +/- 5 sec: ``delay = BatchClient.add_jitter(10, width=5, minima=0)``
