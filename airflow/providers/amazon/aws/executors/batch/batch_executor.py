    The Airflow Scheduler creates a shell command, and passes it to the executor.

    This Batch Executor simply runs said airflow command in a resource provisioned and managed
    by AWS Batch. It then periodically checks in with the launched jobs (via job-ids) to
    determine the status.
    The `submit_job_kwargs` is a dictionary that should match the kwargs for the
    SubmitJob definition per AWS' documentation (see below).
    For maximum flexibility, individual tasks can specify `executor_config` as a dictionary, with keys that
    match the request syntax for the SubmitJob definition per AWS' documentation (see link below). The
    `executor_config` will update the `submit_job_kwargs` dictionary when calling the task. This allows
    individual jobs to specify CPU, memory, GPU, env variables, etc.
    Prerequisite: proper configuration of Boto3 library
    .. seealso:: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html for
    authentication and access-key management. You can store an environmental variable, setup aws config from
    console, or use IAM roles.
