    :param collection_name: A collection name. You can't provide a name and an ID in the same request.

    :param deferrable: If True, the sensor will operate in deferrable more. This mode requires aiobotocore
        module to be installed.
        (default: False, but can be overridden in config file by setting default_deferrable to True)
    :param poke_interval: Polling period in seconds to check for the status of the job. (default: 10)
    :param max_retries: Number of times before returning the current state (default: 60)
    :param aws_conn_id: The Airflow connection used for AWS credentials.
        If this is ``None`` or empty then the default boto3 behaviour is used. If
        running Airflow in a distributed manner and aws_conn_id is None or
        empty, then default boto3 configuration would be used (and must be
        maintained on each worker node).
    :param region_name: AWS region_name. If not specified then the default boto3 behaviour is used.
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates. See:
        https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html
    :param botocore_config: Configuration dictionary (key-values) for botocore client. See:
