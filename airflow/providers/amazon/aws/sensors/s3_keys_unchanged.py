    Checks for changes in the number of objects at prefix in AWS S3
    bucket and returns True if the inactivity period has passed with no
    increase in the number of objects. Note, this sensor will not behave correctly
    in reschedule mode, as the state of the listed objects in the S3 bucket will
    be lost between rescheduled invocations.

    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.

        keys unchanged. Note, this mechanism is not real time and
        this operator may not return until a poke_interval after this period
        has passed with no additional objects sensed.

        sensor to be considered valid.
