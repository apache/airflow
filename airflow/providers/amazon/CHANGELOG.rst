Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
  In this version of the provider, deprecated GCS hook's parameter ``delegate_to`` is removed from the following operators: ``GCSToS3Operator``, ``GlacierToGCSOperator`` and ``GoogleApiToS3Operator``.
  Impersonation can be achieved instead by utilizing the ``impersonation_chain`` param.

  Removed deprecated parameter ``google_cloud_storage_conn_id`` from ``GCSToS3Operator``, ``gcp_conn_id`` should be used instead.

  Removed deprecated parameter ``max_tries`` from the Athena & EMR hook & operators in favor of ``max_polling_attempts``.

  Removed deprecated method ``waiter`` from emr hook in favor of the more generic ``airflow.providers.amazon.aws.utils.waiter.waiter``

  Removed deprecated unused parameter ``cluster_identifier`` from Redshift Cluster's hook method ``get_cluster_snapshot_status``

  Removed deprecated method ``find_processing_job_by_name`` from Sagemaker hook, use ``count_processing_jobs_by_name`` instead.

  Removed deprecated module ``airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.aws_lambda`` in favor of ``airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.lambda_function``

  Removed EcsOperator in favor of EcsRunTaskOperator.
  EcsTaskLogFetcher and EcsProtocol should be imported from the hook.

  Removed AwsLambdaInvokeFunctionOperator in favor of LambdaInvokeFunctionOperator.

  Removed deprecated param ``await_result`` from RedshiftDataOperator in favor of ``wait_for_completion``.
  Some methods from this operator should be imported from the hook instead.

  Removed deprecated ``RedshiftSQLOperator`` in favor of the generic ``SQLExecuteQueryOperator``.
  The parameter that was passed as ``redshift_conn_id`` needs to be changed to ``conn_id``, and the behavior should stay the same.

  Removed deprecated method ``get_conn_uri`` from secrets manager in favor of ``get_conn_value``
  Also removed deprecated method ``get_conn_uri`` from systems manager. ``deserialize_connection(...).get_uri()`` should be used instead.

  Removed deprecated and unused param ``s3_conn_id`` from ``ImapAttachmentToS3Operator``, ``MongoToS3Operator`` and ``S3ToSFTPOperator``.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JSON secrets in the 'SecretsManagerBackend' are never interpreted as urlencoded. In ``5.x`` and ``6.x``, the
code would infer whether the JSON secret values were urlencoded based on context clues; now the unaltered
values are *always* used to construct ``Connection`` objects.

Pandas is now an optional dependency of the provider. The ``SqlToS3Operator`` and ``HiveToDynamoDBOperator``
require Pandas to be installed (you can install it automatically by adding ``[pandas]`` extra when installing
the provider.

Breaking changes

.. warning::
  In this version of provider Amazon S3 Connection (``conn_type="s3"``) removed due to the fact that it was always
  an alias to AWS connection ``conn_type="aws"``
  In practice the only impact is you won't be able to ``test`` the connection in the web UI / API.
  In order to restore ability to test connection you need to change connection type from **Amazon S3** (``conn_type="s3"``)
  to **Amazon Web Services** (``conn_type="aws"``) manually.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CloudFormationCreateStackOperator and CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator
used ``params`` as one of the constructor arguments, however this name clashes with params
argument ``params`` field which is processed differently in Airflow 2.2.
The ``params`` parameter has been renamed to ``cloudformation_parameters`` to make it non-ambiguous.

Any usage of CloudFormationCreateStackOperator and CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator where
``params`` were passed, should be changed to use ``cloudformation_parameters`` instead.

2.3.0
.....

The Redshift operators in this version require at least ``2.3.0`` version of the Postgres Provider. This is
reflected in the ``[postgres]`` extra, but extras do not guarantee that the right version of
dependencies is installed (depending on the installation method). In case you have problems with
running Redshift operators, upgrade ``apache-airflow-providers-postgres`` provider to at least
version 2.3.0.
