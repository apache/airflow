Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CloudFormationCreateStackOperator and CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator
used ``params`` as one of the constructor arguments, however this name clashes with params
argument ``params`` field which is processed differently in Airflow 2.2.
The ``params`` parameter has been renamed to ``cloudformation_parameters`` to make it non-ambiguous.

Any usage of CloudFormationCreateStackOperator and CloudFormationDeleteStackOperator where
``params`` were passed, should be changed to use ``cloudformation_parameters`` instead.

2.3.0
.....

The Redshift operators in this version require at least ``2.3.0`` version of the Postgres Provider. This is
reflected in the ``[postgres]`` extra, but extras do not guarantee that the right version of
dependencies is installed (depending on the installation method). In case you have problems with
running Redshift operators, upgrade ``apache-airflow-providers-postgres`` provider to at least
version 2.3.0.
