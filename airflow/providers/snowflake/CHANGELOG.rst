Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This release of provider is only available for Airflow 2.3+ as explained in the
`Apache Airflow providers support policy <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/README.md#support-for-providers>`_.

The ``SnowflakeHook`` is now conforming to the same semantics as all the other ``DBApiHook``
implementations and returns the same kind of response in its ``run`` method. Previously (pre 4.* versions
of the provider, the Hook returned Dictionary of ``{ "column": "value" ... }`` which was not compatible
with other DBApiHooks that return just sequence of sequences. After this change (and dependency
on common.sql >= 1.3.1),the ``SnowflakeHook`` returns now python DbApi-compatible "results" by default.

The ``description`` (i.e. among others names and types of columns returned) can be retrieved
via ``descriptions`` and ``last_description`` fields of the hook after ``run`` method completes.

That makes the ``DatabricksSqlHook`` suitable for generic SQL operator and detailed lineage analysis.

If you had custom hooks or used the Hook in your TaskFlow code or custom operators that relied on this
behaviour, you need to adapt your DAGs or you can switch back the ``SnowflakeHook`` to return dictionaries
by passing ``return_dictionaries=True`` to the run method of the hook.

The ``SnowflakeOperator`` is also more standard and derives from common
``SQLExecuteQueryOperator`` and uses more consistent approach to process output when SQL queries are run.
However in this case the result returned by ``execute`` method is unchanged (it still returns Dictionaries
rather than sequences and those dictionaries are pushed to XCom, so your DAGs relying on this behaviour
should continue working without any change.

In SnowflakeHook, if both ``extra__snowflake__foo`` and ``foo`` existed in connection extra
dict, the prefixed version would be used; now, the non-prefixed version will be preferred.

The ``4.0.0`` and ``4.0.1`` versions have been broken and yanked, so the 4.0.2 is the first change from the
``4.*`` line that should be used.
