Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   We bumped the minimum version of weaviate-client to 4.4.0. Many of the concepts and methods have been changed.
   We suggest you read `Migrate from v3 to v4 <https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python/v3_v4_migration>`_ before you upgrade to this version

  Summary of the key changes:
    * Add columns ``Port``, ``gRPC host``, ``gRPC port``  and ``Use https``, ``Use a secure channel for the underlying gRPC API`` options  to the Weaviate connection. The default values from Airflow providers may not be suitable for using Weaviate correctly, so we recommend explicitly specifying these values.
    * Update ``WeaviateIngestOperator`` and ``WeaviateDocumentIngestOperator`` to use ``WeaviateHook`` with ``weaviate-client`` v4 API. The major changes are changing argument ``class_name`` to ``collection_name`` and removing ``batch_params``.
    * Update ``WeaviateHook`` to utilize ``weaviate-client`` v4 API. The implementation has been extensively changed. We recommend reading `Migrate from v3 to v4 <https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python/v3_v4_migration>`_ to understand the changes on the Weaviate side before using the updated ``WeaviateHook``.
    * Migrate the following ``WeaviateHook`` public methods to v4 API: ``test_connections``, ``query_with_vector``, ``create_object``, ``get_object``, ``delete_object``, ``update_object``, ``replace_object``, ``object_exists``, ``batch_data``, ``get_or_create_object``, ``create_or_replace_document_objects``
    * Rename ``WeaviateHook`` public methods ``update_schema`` as ``update_collection_configuration``, ``create_class`` as ``create_collection``, ``get_schema`` as ``get_collection_configuration``, ``delete_classes`` as ``delete_collections`` and ``query_without_vector`` as ``query_with_text``.
    * Remove the following ``WeaviateHook`` public methods: ``validate_object``, ``update_schema``, ``create_schema``, ``delete_all_schema``, ``check_subset_of_schema``
    * Remove deprecated method ``WeaviateHook.get_client``
    * Remove unused argument ``retry_status_codes`` in ``WeaviateHook.__init__``

* ``Upgrade to weaviate-client to v4 (#40194)``
