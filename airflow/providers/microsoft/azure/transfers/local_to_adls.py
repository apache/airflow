    :param local_path: local path. Can be single file, directory (in which case,
            upload recursively) or glob pattern. Recursive glob patterns using `**`
            are not supported

            directory root to write within
    :param nthreads: Number of threads to use. If None, uses the number of cores.
    :param overwrite: Whether to forcibly overwrite existing files/directories.
            If False and remote path is a directory, will quit regardless if any files
            would be overwritten or not. If True, only matching filenames are actually
            overwritten

            Number of bytes for a block. Within each chunk, we write a smaller
            block for each API call. This block cannot be bigger than a chunk
