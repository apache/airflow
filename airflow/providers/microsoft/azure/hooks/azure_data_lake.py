This module contains integration with Azure Data Lake.

AzureDataLakeHook communicates via a REST API compatible with WebHDFS. Make sure that a
Airflow connection of type `azure_data_lake` exists. Authorization can be done by supplying a
login (=Client ID), password (=Client Secret) and extra fields tenant (Tenant) and account_name (Account Name)
(see connection `azure_data_lake_default` for an example).
