In case of SMTP SSL connection, the default context now uses "default" context

The "default" context is Python's ``default_ssl_context`` instead of previously used "none". The
``default_ssl_context`` provides a balance between security and compatibility but in some cases,
when certificates are old, self-signed or misconfigured, it might not work. This can be configured
by setting "ssl_context" in "smtp_provider" configuration of the provider. If it is not explicitly set,
it will default to "email", "ssl_context" setting in Airflow.

Setting it to "none" brings back the "none" setting that was used in previous versions of the provider,
but it is not recommended due to security reasons ad this setting disables validation
of certificates and allows MITM attacks.

You can also override "ssl_context" per-connection by setting "ssl_context" in the connection extra.

* ``Add possibility to use 'ssl_context' extra for SMTP and IMAP connections (#33112)``
* ``Allows to choose SSL context for SMTP provider (#33075)``
