Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Changing atlassian JIRA SDK to official atlassian-python-api SDK (#27633)``

Migrated ``Jira`` provider from Atlassian ``Jira`` SDK to ``atlassian-python-api`` SDK.
``Jira`` provider doesn't support ``validate`` and ``get_server_info`` in connection extra dict.
Changed the return type of ``JiraHook.get_conn`` to return an ``atlassian.Jira`` object instead of a ``jira.Jira`` object.

.. warning:: Due to the underlying SDK change, the ``JiraOperator`` now requires ``jira_method`` and ``jira_method_args``
             arguments as per ``atlassian-python-api``.

             Please refer `Atlassian Python API Documentation <https://atlassian-python-api.readthedocs.io/jira.html>`__
