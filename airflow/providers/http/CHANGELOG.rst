4.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SimpleHTTPOperator, HttpSensor and HttpHook use now TCP_KEEPALIVE by default.
You can disable it by setting ``tcp_keep_alive`` to False and you can control keepalive parameters
by new ``tcp_keep_alive_*`` parameters added to constructor of the Hook, Operator and Sensor. Setting the
TCP_KEEPALIVE prevents some firewalls from closing a long-running connection that has long periods of
inactivity by sending empty TCP packets periodically. This has a very small impact on network traffic,
and potentially prevents the idle/hanging connections from being closed automatically by the firewalls.

* ``Add TCP_KEEPALIVE option to http provider (#24967)``

.. Below changes are excluded from the changelog. Move them to
   appropriate section above if needed. Do not delete the lines(!):

   * ``Move provider dependencies to inside provider folders (#24672)``
   * ``Remove 'hook-class-names' from provider.yaml (#24702)``
