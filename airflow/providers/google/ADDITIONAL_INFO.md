## Additional notes

The BigQuery classes are undergoing heavy rewriting. The implementation in Airflow 2.0 will not
be fully backwards compatible with the old BigQuery operators. Therefore, the BigQuery classes
have been stripped out of the current release of the backport packages. We will add the
BigQuery Classes back in one of the future releases of the provider's package.
