# This is the template for Airflow's default configuration. When Airflow is
# imported, it looks for a configuration file at $AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg. If
# it doesn't exist, Airflow uses this template to generate it by replacing
# variables in curly braces with their global values from configuration.py.

# Users should not modify this file; they should customize the generated
# airflow.cfg instead.
