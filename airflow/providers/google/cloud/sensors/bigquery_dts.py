    :param expected_statuses: The expected state of the operation.
        See:
        https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/reference/rest/v1/transferOperations#Status
    :param run_id: ID of the transfer run.
    :param transfer_config_id: ID of transfer config to be used.
    :param project_id: The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be
        created. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
    :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
        specified, requests will not be retried.
    :param request_timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
        complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
        attempt.
    :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
