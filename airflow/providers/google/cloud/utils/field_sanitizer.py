"""Sanitizer for body fields sent via Google Cloud API.

The sanitizer removes fields specified from the body.

Context
-------
In some cases where Google Cloud operation requires modification of existing resources (such
as instances or instance templates) we need to sanitize body of the resources returned
via Google Cloud APIs. This is in the case when we retrieve information from Google Cloud first,
modify the body and either update the existing resource or create a new one with the
modified body. Usually when you retrieve resource from Google Cloud you get some extra fields which
are Output-only, and we need to delete those fields if we want to use
the body as input for subsequent create/insert type operation.


Field specification
-------------------

Specification of fields is an array of strings which denote names of fields to be removed.
The field can be either direct field name to remove from the body or the full
specification of the path you should delete - separated with '.'


>>> FIELDS_TO_SANITIZE = [
>>>    "kind",

{
    "name":  "instance",
    "properties": {
        "disks": [
            {
                "name": "a",
                "type": "PERSISTENT",
                "mode": "READ_WRITE",
            },
            {
                "name": "b",
                "type": "PERSISTENT",
                "mode": "READ_WRITE",
            }
        ],
        "metadata": {
            "fingerprint": "GDPUYxlwHe4="
        },
    }
}

Note that the components of the path can be either dictionaries or arrays of dictionaries.
In case  they are dictionaries, subsequent component names key of the field, in case of
arrays - the sanitizer iterates through all dictionaries in the array and searches
components in all elements of the array.
