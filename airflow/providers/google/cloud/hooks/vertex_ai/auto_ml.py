        :param project_id: Required. Project to run training in.
        :param region: Required. Location to run training in.
        :param display_name: Required. The user-defined name of this TrainingPipeline.
        :param dataset: Required. The dataset within the same Project from which data will be used to train
            the Model. The Dataset must use schema compatible with Model being trained, and what is
            compatible should be described in the used TrainingPipeline's [training_task_definition]
            [google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.TrainingPipeline.training_task_definition]. For tabular
            Datasets, all their data is exported to training, to pick and choose from.
        :param target_column: Required. The name of the column values of which the Model is to predict.
        :param optimization_prediction_type: The type of prediction the Model is to produce.
            "classification" - Predict one out of multiple target values is picked for each row.
            "regression" - Predict a value based on its relation to other values. This type is available only
            to columns that contain semantically numeric values, i.e. integers or floating point number, even
            if stored as e.g. strings.
        :param optimization_objective: Optional. Objective function the Model is to be optimized towards.
            The training task creates a Model that maximizes/minimizes the value of the objective function
            over the validation set.

            The supported optimization objectives depend on the prediction type, and in the case of
            classification also the number of distinct values in the target column (two distinct values
            -> binary, 3 or more distinct values -> multi class). If the field is not set, the default
            objective function is used.

            Classification (binary):
            "maximize-au-roc" (default) - Maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
            curve.
            "minimize-log-loss" - Minimize log loss.
            "maximize-au-prc" - Maximize the area under the precision-recall curve.
            "maximize-precision-at-recall" - Maximize precision for a specified recall value.
            "maximize-recall-at-precision" - Maximize recall for a specified precision value.

            Classification (multi class):
            "minimize-log-loss" (default) - Minimize log loss.

            Regression:
            "minimize-rmse" (default) - Minimize root-mean-squared error (RMSE).
            "minimize-mae" - Minimize mean-absolute error (MAE).
            "minimize-rmsle" - Minimize root-mean-squared log error (RMSLE).
        :param column_specs: Optional. Alternative to column_transformations where the keys of the dict are
            column names and their respective values are one of AutoMLTabularTrainingJob.column_data_types.
            When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct column, the column should be flattened using "."
            as the delimiter. Only columns with no child should have a transformation. If an input column has
            no transformations on it, such a column is ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn,
            which should have no transformations defined on. Only one of column_transformations or
            column_specs should be passed.
        :param column_transformations: Optional. Transformations to apply to the input columns (i.e. columns
            other than the targetColumn). Each transformation may produce multiple result values from the
            column's value, and all are used for training. When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct
            column, the column should be flattened using "." as the delimiter. Only columns with no child
            should have a transformation. If an input column has no transformations on it, such a column is
            ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn, which should have no transformations
            defined on. Only one of column_transformations or column_specs should be passed. Consider using
            column_specs as column_transformations will be deprecated eventually.
        :param optimization_objective_recall_value: Optional. Required when maximize-precision-at-recall
            optimizationObjective was picked, represents the recall value at which the optimization is done.
            The minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 1.0.
        :param optimization_objective_precision_value: Optional. Required when maximize-recall-at-precision
            optimizationObjective was picked, represents the precision value at which the optimization is
            done.
            The minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 1.0.
        :param labels: Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize TrainingPipelines. Label
            keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain
            lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
            allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
        :param training_encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
            managed encryption key used to protect the training pipeline. Has the form:
            ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``. The key needs to be
            in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If set, this TrainingPipeline will
            be secured by this key.
            Note: Model trained by this TrainingPipeline is also secured by this key if ``model_to_upload``
            is not set separately.
        :param model_encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
            managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the form:
            ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``. The key needs to be
            in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If set, the trained Model will be
            secured by this key.
        :param training_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param validation_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to
            validate the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param test_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param predefined_split_column_name: Optional. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data
            columns. The value of the key (either the label's value or value in the column) must be one of
            {``training``, ``validation``, ``test``}, and it defines to which set the given piece of data is
            assigned. If for a piece of data the key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is
            ignored by the pipeline. Supported only for tabular and time series Datasets.
        :param timestamp_split_column_name: Optional. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data columns.
            The value of the key values of the key (the values in the column) must be in RFC 3339 `date-time`
            format, where `time-offset` = `"Z"` (e.g. 1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z). If for a piece of data the
            key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is ignored by the pipeline. Supported only
            for tabular and time series Datasets. This parameter must be used with training_fraction_split,
            validation_fraction_split and test_fraction_split.
        :param weight_column: Optional. Name of the column that should be used as the weight column. Higher
            values in this column give more importance to the row during Model training. The column must have
            numeric values between 0 and 10000 inclusively, and 0 value means that the row is ignored. If the
            weight column field is not set, then all rows are assumed to have equal weight of 1.
        :param budget_milli_node_hours (int): Optional. The train budget of creating this Model, expressed in
            milli node hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour. The training cost of the model
            will not exceed this budget. The final cost will be attempted to be close to the budget, though
            may end up being (even) noticeably smaller - at the backend's discretion. This especially may
            happen when further model training ceases to provide any improvements. If the budget is set to a
            value known to be insufficient to train a Model for the given training set, the training won't be

            the Model. The Dataset must use schema compatible with Model being trained, and what is
            compatible should be described in the used TrainingPipeline's [training_task_definition]
            [google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.TrainingPipeline.training_task_definition]. For time series
            Datasets, all their data is exported to training, to pick and choose from.
        :param target_column: Required. Name of the column that the Model is to predict values for.
        :param time_column: Required. Name of the column that identifies time order in the time series.

            forecast. Each column contains information for the given entity (identified by the
            [time_series_identifier_column]) that is unknown before the forecast (e.g. population of a city
            in a given year, or weather on a given day).
        :param available_at_forecast_columns: Required. Column names of columns that are available at
            forecast. Each column contains information for the given entity (identified by the
            [time_series_identifier_column]) that is known at forecast.
        :param forecast_horizon: Required. The amount of time into the future for which forecasted values for
            the target are returned. Expressed in number of units defined by the [data_granularity_unit] and

            column names and their respective values are one of AutoMLTabularTrainingJob.column_data_types.
            When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct column, the column should be flattened using "."
            as the delimiter. Only columns with no child should have a transformation. If an input column has
            no transformations on it, such a column is ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn,
            which should have no transformations defined on. Only one of column_transformations or
            column_specs should be passed.
        :param column_transformations: Optional. Transformations to apply to the input columns (i.e. columns
            other than the targetColumn). Each transformation may produce multiple result values from the
            column's value, and all are used for training. When creating transformation for BigQuery Struct
            column, the column should be flattened using "." as the delimiter. Only columns with no child
            should have a transformation. If an input column has no transformations on it, such a column is
            ignored by the training, except for the targetColumn, which should have no transformations
            defined on. Only one of column_transformations or column_specs should be passed. Consider using
            column_specs as column_transformations will be deprecated eventually.
        :param labels: Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize TrainingPipelines. Label
            keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain
            lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are

        :param training_encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
            managed encryption key used to protect the training pipeline. Has the form:
            ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``. The key needs to be
            in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If set, this TrainingPipeline will
            be secured by this key.
            Note: Model trained by this TrainingPipeline is also secured by this key if ``model_to_upload``
            is not set separately.
        :param model_encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
            managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the form:
            ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``. The key needs to be
            in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
            If set, the trained Model will be secured by this key.
        :param training_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param validation_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to
            validate the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param test_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param predefined_split_column_name: Optional. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data
            columns. The value of the key (either the label's value or value in the column) must be one of
            {``TRAIN``, ``VALIDATE``, ``TEST``}, and it defines to which set the given piece of data is
            assigned. If for a piece of data the key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is
            ignored by the pipeline.
            Supported only for tabular and time series Datasets.
        :param weight_column: Optional. Name of the column that should be used as the weight column. Higher
            values in this column give more importance to the row during Model training. The column must have
            numeric values between 0 and 10000 inclusively, and 0 value means that the row is ignored. If the
            weight column field is not set, then all rows are assumed to have equal weight of 1.
        :param time_series_attribute_columns: Optional. Column names that should be used as attribute
            columns. Each column is constant within a time series.
        :param context_window: Optional. The amount of time into the past training and prediction data is
            used for model training and prediction respectively. Expressed in number of units defined by the
            [data_granularity_unit] and [data_granularity_count] fields. When not provided uses the default
            value of 0 which means the model sets each series context window to be 0 (also known as "cold
            start"). Inclusive.
        :param export_evaluated_data_items: Whether to export the test set predictions to a BigQuery table.
            If False, then the export is not performed.
        :param export_evaluated_data_items_bigquery_destination_uri: Optional. URI of desired destination
            BigQuery table for exported test set predictions. Expected format:
            ``bq://<project_id>:<dataset_id>:<table>``
            If not specified, then results are exported to the following auto-created BigQuery table:
            ``<project_id>:export_evaluated_examples_<model_name>_<yyyy_MM_dd'T'HH_mm_ss_SSS'Z'>
            .evaluated_examples``
            Applies only if [export_evaluated_data_items] is True.
        :param export_evaluated_data_items_override_destination: Whether to override the contents of
            [export_evaluated_data_items_bigquery_destination_uri], if the table exists, for exported test
            set predictions. If False, and the table exists, then the training job will fail.
            Applies only if [export_evaluated_data_items] is True and
            [export_evaluated_data_items_bigquery_destination_uri] is specified.
        :param quantiles: Quantiles to use for the `minizmize-quantile-loss`
            [AutoMLForecastingTrainingJob.optimization_objective]. This argument is required in this case.
            Accepts up to 5 quantiles in the form of a double from 0 to 1, exclusive. Each quantile must be
            unique.
        :param validation_options: Validation options for the data validation component. The available
            options are: "fail-pipeline" - (default), will validate against the validation and fail the
            pipeline if it fails. "ignore-validation" - ignore the results of the validation and continue the
            pipeline
        :param budget_milli_node_hours: Optional. The train budget of creating this Model, expressed in milli
            node hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour. The training cost of the model will
            not exceed this budget. The final cost will be attempted to be close to the budget, though may
            end up being (even) noticeably smaller - at the backend's discretion. This especially may happen
            when further model training ceases to provide any improvements. If the budget is set to a value
            known to be insufficient to train a Model for the given training set, the training won't be
            attempted and will error. The minimum value is 1000 and the maximum is 72000.
        :param model_display_name: Optional. If the script produces a managed Vertex AI Model. The display
            name of the Model. The name can be up to 128 characters long and can be consist of any UTF-8
            characters. If not provided upon creation, the job's display_name is used.
        :param model_labels: Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your Models. Label
            keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain
            lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
            allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.

            be applicable).
            This is only applicable for the "classification" prediction_type and will be ignored otherwise.
        :param model_type: Required. One of the following:

            from scratch. The `base` model must be in the same Project and Location as the new Model to
            train, and have the same model_type.
        :param labels: Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize TrainingPipelines. Label
            keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain
            lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are

            The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
            If set, the trained Model will be secured by this key.
        :param training_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param validation_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to
            validate the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param test_fraction_split: Optional. The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate
            the Model. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param training_filter_split: Optional. A filter on DataItems of the Dataset. DataItems that match
            this filter are used to train the Model. A filter with same syntax as the one used in
            DatasetService.ListDataItems may be used. If a single DataItem is matched by more than one of the
            FilterSplit filters, then it is assigned to the first set that applies to it in the training,
            validation, test order. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param validation_filter_split: Optional. A filter on DataItems of the Dataset. DataItems that match
            this filter are used to validate the Model. A filter with same syntax as the one used in
            DatasetService.ListDataItems may be used. If a single DataItem is matched by more than one of the

            validation, test order. This is ignored if Dataset is not provided.
        :param budget_milli_node_hours: Optional. The train budget of creating this Model, expressed in milli
            node hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node hour.
            Defaults by `prediction_type`:
            `classification` - For Cloud models the budget must be: 8,000 - 800,000 milli node hours
            (inclusive). The default value is 192,000 which represents one day in wall time, assuming 8 nodes
            are used.
            `object_detection` - For Cloud models the budget must be: 20,000 - 900,000 milli node hours
            (inclusive). The default value is 216,000 which represents one day in wall time, assuming 9 nodes
            are used.
            The training cost of the model will not exceed this budget. The final cost will be attempted to
            be close to the budget, though may end up being (even) noticeably smaller - at the backend's
            discretion. This especially may happen when further model training ceases to provide any
            improvements. If the budget is set to a value known to be insufficient to train a Model for the
            given training set, the training won't be attempted and will error.
        :param model_display_name: Optional. The display name of the managed Vertex AI Model. The name can be
            up to 128 characters long and can be consist of any UTF-8 characters. If not provided upon
            creation, the job's display_name is used.
        :param model_labels: Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your Models. Label
            keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain
            lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
            allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels.
        :param disable_early_stopping: Required. If true, the entire budget is used. This disables the early
            stopping feature. By default, the early stopping feature is enabled, which means that training
            might stop before the entire training budget has been used, if further training does no longer
            brings significant improvement to the model.
        :param sync: Whether to execute this method synchronously. If False, this method will be executed in
            concurrent Future and any downstream object will be immediately returned and synced when the
            Future has completed.

            The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
            If set, this TrainingPipeline will be secured by this key.
            Note: Model trained by this TrainingPipeline is also secured by this key if ``model_to_upload``
            is not set separately.
        :param model_encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
