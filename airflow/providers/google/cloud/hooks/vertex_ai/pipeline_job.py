        :param display_name: Required. The user-defined name of this Pipeline.
        :param template_path: Required. The path of PipelineJob or PipelineSpec JSON or YAML file. It can be
            a local path, a Google Cloud Storage URI (e.g. "gs://project.name"), an Artifact Registry URI
            (e.g. "https://us-central1-kfp.pkg.dev/proj/repo/pack/latest"), or an HTTPS URI.
        :param job_id: Optional. The unique ID of the job run. If not specified, pipeline name + timestamp
            will be used.
        :param pipeline_root: Optional. The root of the pipeline outputs. If not set, the staging bucket set
            in aiplatform.init will be used. If that's not set a pipeline-specific artifacts bucket will be

            ("projects/123/locations/us-central1/metadataStores/default/artifacts/456") cannot be used.

            If this is not set, defaults to the compile time settings, which are True for all tasks by
            default, while users may specify different caching options for individual tasks.
            If this is set, the setting applies to all tasks in the pipeline. Overrides the compile time
            settings.

            ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
            The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If this is set,
            then all resources created by the PipelineJob will be encrypted with the provided encryption key.
            Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
        :param labels: Optional. The user defined metadata to organize PipelineJob.
        :param failure_policy: Optional. The failure policy - "slow" or "fast". Currently, the default of a
            pipeline is that the pipeline will continue to run until no more tasks can be executed, also
            known as PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_SLOW (corresponds to "slow"). However, if a pipeline is set
            to PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_FAST (corresponds to "fast"), it will stop scheduling any new
            tasks when a task has failed. Any scheduled tasks will continue to completion.
        :param service_account: Optional. Specifies the service account for workload run-as account. Users
            submitting jobs must have act-as permission on this run-as account.
        :param network: Optional. The full name of the Compute Engine network to which the job should be
            peered. For example, projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC.
            Private services access must already be configured for the network. If left unspecified, the
            network set in aiplatform.init will be used. Otherwise, the job is not peered with any network.
        :param create_request_timeout: Optional. The timeout for the create request in seconds.
        :param experiment: Optional. The Vertex AI experiment name or instance to associate to this
            PipelineJob. Metrics produced by the PipelineJob as system.Metric Artifacts will be associated as
            metrics to the current Experiment Run. Pipeline parameters will be associated as parameters to

               3339 format.
            -  ``labels``: Supports key-value equality and key presence.

            Filter expressions can be combined together using logical
            operators (``AND`` & ``OR``). For example:
            ``pipeline_name="test" AND create_time>"2020-05-18T13:30:00Z"``.

            The syntax to define filter expression is based on
            https://google.aip.dev/160.
        :param page_size: Optional. The standard list page size.
        :param page_token: Optional. The standard list page token. Typically obtained via
            [ListPipelineJobsResponse.next_page_token][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ListPipelineJobsResponse.next_page_token]
            of the previous
            [PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs]
            call.
        :param order_by: Optional. A comma-separated list of fields to order by. The default
            sort order is in ascending order. Use "desc" after a field
            name for descending. You can have multiple order_by fields
            provided e.g. "create_time desc, end_time", "end_time,
            start_time, update_time" For example, using "create_time
            desc, end_time" will order results by create time in
            descending order, and if there are multiple jobs having the
            same create time, order them by the end time in ascending
            order. if order_by is not specified, it will order by
            default order is create time in descending order. Supported
            fields:

            -  ``create_time``
            -  ``update_time``
            -  ``end_time``
            -  ``start_time``
        :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
        :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
