            that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
        :param retain_acked_messages: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged
            messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's
            backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
            ``message_retention_duration`` window. This must be true if you would
            like to Seek to a timestamp.
        :param message_retention_duration: How long to retain unacknowledged messages
            in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
            ``retain_acked_messages`` is true, then this also configures the
            retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in
            time a ``Seek`` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7
            days or less than 10 minutes.
        :param labels: Client-assigned labels; see
            https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels

            ordering_key in PubsubMessage will be delivered to the subscribers in the order
            in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be
            delivered in any order.

            subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any
            connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or
            is issuing operations on the subscription. If expiration_policy is not set,
            a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for
            expiration_policy.ttl is 1 day.
        :param filter_: An expression written in the Cloud Pub/Sub filter language. If
            non-empty, then only PubsubMessages whose attributes field matches the filter are
            delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
        :param dead_letter_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
            messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is
            disabled.
        :param retry_policy: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery
            for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This
            generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy
            subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline
            exceeded events for a given message.
        :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests.
            If None is specified, requests will not be retried.
        :param timeout: (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request
            to complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each
