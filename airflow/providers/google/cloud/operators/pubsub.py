        If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
    :param topic: the topic to create. Do not include the
        full topic path. In other words, instead of
        ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic}``, provide only
        ``{topic}``. (templated)
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to

        of Google Cloud regions where messages published to

    ``project_id``, ``topic``, ``subscription``, ``subscription_project_id`` and
    ``impersonation_chain`` are templated so you can use Jinja templating in their values.

    :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID where the topic exists.
        If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
    :param topic: the topic to create. Do not include the
        full topic path. In other words, instead of
        ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic}``, provide only
        ``{topic}``. (templated)
    :param subscription: the Pub/Sub subscription name. If empty, a random
        name will be generated using the uuid module
    :param subscription_project_id: the Google Cloud project ID where the subscription
        will be created. If empty, ``topic_project`` will be used.
    :param ack_deadline_secs: Number of seconds that a subscriber has to
        acknowledge each message pulled from the subscription
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to
        Google Cloud.
    :param push_config: If push delivery is used with this subscription,
        this field is used to configure it. An empty ``pushConfig`` signifies
        that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
    :param retain_acked_messages: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged
        messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's
        backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
        ``message_retention_duration`` window. This must be true if you would
        like to Seek to a timestamp.
    :param message_retention_duration: How long to retain unacknowledged messages
        in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
        ``retain_acked_messages`` is true, then this also configures the
        retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in
        time a ``Seek`` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7
        days or less than 10 minutes.
    :param labels: Client-assigned labels; see
        https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels
    :param enable_message_ordering: If true, messages published with the same
        ordering_key in PubsubMessage will be delivered to the subscribers in the order
        in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be
        delivered in any order.
    :param expiration_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for this
        subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any
        connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or
        is issuing operations on the subscription. If expiration_policy is not set,
        a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for
        expiration_policy.ttl is 1 day.
    :param filter_: An expression written in the Cloud Pub/Sub filter language. If
        non-empty, then only PubsubMessages whose attributes field matches the filter are
        delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
    :param dead_letter_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
        messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is
        disabled.
    :param retry_policy: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery
        for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This
        generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy
        subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline
        exceeded events for a given message.
    :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests.
        If None is specified, requests will not be retried.
    :param timeout: (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request
        to complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each
        individual attempt.
    :param metadata: (Optional) Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
