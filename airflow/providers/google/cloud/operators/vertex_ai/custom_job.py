        the role of the DataItem they are on.

        When used in conjunction with
        ``annotations_filter``,
        the Annotations used for training are filtered by both
        ``annotations_filter``
        and
        ``annotation_schema_uri``.
    :param model_display_name: If the script produces a managed Vertex AI Model. The display name of

            this filter are used to train the Model. A filter with same syntax
            as the one used in DatasetService.ListDataItems may be used. If a
            single DataItem is matched by more than one of the FilterSplit filters,

            ``validation``, ``test``}, and it defines to which set the
            given piece of data is assigned. If for a piece of data the
            key is not present or has an invalid value, that piece is
            ignored by the pipeline.
