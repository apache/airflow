        the role of the DataItem they are on.

        When used in conjunction with
        ``annotations_filter``,
        the Annotations used for training are filtered by both
        ``annotations_filter``
        and
        ``annotation_schema_uri``.
    :param model_display_name: If the script produces a managed Vertex AI Model. The display name of

    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,

        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
