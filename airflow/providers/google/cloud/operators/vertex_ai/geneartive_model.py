    Uses the Vertex AI PaLM API to generate natural language text.

        service belongs to.
    :param location: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud location that the
        service belongs to.
    :param prompt: Required. Inputs or queries that a user or a program gives
        to the Vertex AI PaLM API, in order to elicit a specific response.
    :param pretrained_model: By default uses the pre-trained model `text-bison`,
        optimized for performing natural language tasks such as classification,
        summarization, extraction, content creation, and ideation.
    :param temperature: Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token
        selection. Defaults to 0.0.
    :param max_output_tokens: Token limit determines the maximum amount of text
        output. Defaults to 256.
    :param top_p: Tokens are selected from most probable to least until the sum
        of their probabilities equals the top_p value. Defaults to 0.8.
    :param top_k: A top_k of 1 means the selected token is the most probable
        among all tokens. Defaults to 0.4.
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.

        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
