    .. note:: To locate the `Product` resource, its `name` in the form
        `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/products/PRODUCT_ID` is necessary.

    You can provide the `name` directly as an attribute of the `product` object. However, you can leave it
    blank and provide `location` and `product_id` instead (and optionally `project_id` - if not present,
    the connection default will be used) and the `name` will be created by the operator itself.

    This mechanism exists for your convenience, to allow leaving the `project_id` empty and having Airflow
    use the connection default `project_id`.

    Possible errors related to the provided `Product`:

    - Returns `NOT_FOUND` if the Product does not exist.
    - Returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if `display_name` is present in update_mask but is missing from the request
        or longer than 4096 characters.

    :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
        specified, requests will not be retried.
    :param timeout: Number of seconds before timing out.
    :param additional_properties: Additional properties to be set on the AnnotateImageRequest. See more:

    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
