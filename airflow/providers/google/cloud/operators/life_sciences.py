    :param body: The request body
    :param location: The location of the project
    :param project_id: ID of the Google Cloud project if None then
        default project_id is used.
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param api_version: API version used (for example v2beta).
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
