## Additional info

### Breaking change in `AutoMLBatchPredictOperator`

Class `AutoMLBatchPredictOperator` property `params` is renamed to `prediction_params`.
To keep old behaviour, please rename `params` to `prediction_params` when initializing an instance of `AutoMLBatchPredictOperator`.

Property `params` still exists, but as a property inherited from parent's class `BaseOperator`.
Property `params` has nothing to do with prediction, use `prediction_params` instead.
