Example Airflow DAG that sense a cloud task queue being empty.

This DAG relies on the following OS environment variables

* GCP_PROJECT_ID - Google Cloud project where the Compute Engine instance exists.
* GCP_ZONE - Google Cloud zone where the cloud task queue exists.
* QUEUE_NAME - Name of the cloud task queue.
