    Sync an Azure FileShare directory with a Google Cloud Storage destination path.

    Does not include subdirectories.  May be filtered by prefix.

    :param share_name: The Azure FileShare share where to find the objects. (templated)
    :param directory_name: (Optional) Path to Azure FileShare directory which content is to be transferred.
        Defaults to root directory (templated)
    :param prefix: Prefix string which filters objects whose name begin with
        such prefix. (templated)
    :param azure_fileshare_conn_id: The source WASB connection
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param dest_gcs: The destination Google Cloud Storage bucket and prefix
        where you want to store the files. (templated)
    :param replace: Whether you want to replace existing destination files
        or not.
    :param gzip: Option to compress file for upload
    :param google_impersonation_chain: Optional Google service account to impersonate using
        short-term credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

    Note that ``share_name``, ``directory_name``, ``prefix``, ``delimiter`` and ``dest_gcs`` are
    templated, so you can use variables in them if you wish.
