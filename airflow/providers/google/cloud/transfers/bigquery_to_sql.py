    Fetch data from a BigQuery table (alternatively fetch selected columns) and insert it into an SQL table.

    This is a BaseOperator; an abstract class. Refer to children classes
    which are related to specific SQL databases (MySQL, MsSQL, Postgres...).

    .. note::
        If you pass fields to ``selected_fields`` which are in different order than the
        order of columns already in
        BQ table, the data will still be in the order of BQ table.
        For example if the BQ table has 3 columns as
        ``[A,B,C]`` and you pass 'B,A' in the ``selected_fields``
        the data would still be of the form ``'A,B'`` and passed through this form
        to the SQL database.

    :param dataset_table: A dotted ``<dataset>.<table>``: the big query table of origin
    :param target_table_name: target SQL table
    :param selected_fields: List of fields to return (comma-separated). If
        unspecified, all fields are returned.
    :param gcp_conn_id: reference to a specific Google Cloud hook.
    :param database: name of database which overwrite defined one in connection
    :param replace: Whether to replace instead of insert
    :param batch_size: The number of rows to take in each batch
    :param location: The location used for the operation.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
