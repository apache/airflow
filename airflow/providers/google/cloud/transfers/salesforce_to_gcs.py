    :param export_format: Desired format of files to be exported.
    :param coerce_to_timestamp: True if you want all datetime fields to be converted into Unix timestamps.
        False if you want them to be left in the same format as they were in Salesforce.
        Leaving the value as False will result in datetimes being strings. Default: False
