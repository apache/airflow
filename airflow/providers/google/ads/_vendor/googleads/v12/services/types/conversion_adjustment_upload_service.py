            adjustment_type is ENHANCEMENT, this value is optional but
            may be set in addition to the order_id.
        order_id (str):
            The order ID of the conversion to be
            adjusted. If the conversion was reported with an
            order ID specified, that order ID must be used
            as the identifier here. The order ID is required
            for enhancements.

        conversion_action (str):
            Resource name of the conversion action
            associated with this conversion adjustment.
            Note: Although this resource name consists of a
            customer id and a conversion action id,

            Information needed to restate the
            conversion's value. Required for restatements.
            Should not be supplied for retractions. An error
            will be returned if provided for a retraction.
            NOTE: If you want to upload a second restatement
            with a different adjusted value, it must have a
            new, more recent, adjustment occurrence time.

            The user agent to enhance the original conversion. This can
            be found in your user's HTTP request header when they
            convert on your web page. Example, "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU
