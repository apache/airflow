        r"""Return a callable for the mutate method over gRPC.

        Creates, updates, or removes resources. This method supports
        atomic transactions with multiple types of resources. For
        example, you can atomically create a campaign and a campaign
        budget, or perform up to thousands of mutates atomically.

        This method is essentially a wrapper around a series of mutate
        methods. The only features it offers over calling those methods
        directly are:

        -  Atomic transactions
        -  Temp resource names (described below)
        -  Somewhat reduced latency over making a series of mutate calls

        Note: Only resources that support atomic transactions are
        included, so this method can't replace all calls to individual
        services.

        Atomic Transaction Benefits
        ---------------------------

        Atomicity makes error handling much easier. If you're making a
        series of changes and one fails, it can leave your account in an
        inconsistent state. With atomicity, you either reach the chosen
        state directly, or the request fails and you can retry.

        Temp Resource Names
        -------------------

        Temp resource names are a special type of resource name used to
        create a resource and reference that resource in the same
        request. For example, if a campaign budget is created with
        ``resource_name`` equal to ``customers/123/campaignBudgets/-1``,
        that resource name can be reused in the ``Campaign.budget``
        field in the same request. That way, the two resources are
        created and linked atomically.

        To create a temp resource name, put a negative number in the
        part of the name that the server would normally allocate.

        Note:

        -  Resources must be created with a temp name before the name
           can be reused. For example, the previous
           CampaignBudget+Campaign example would fail if the mutate
           order was reversed.
        -  Temp names are not remembered across requests.
        -  There's no limit to the number of temp names in a request.
        -  Each temp name must use a unique negative number, even if the
           resource types differ.

        Latency
        -------

        It's important to group mutates by resource type or the request
        may time out and fail. Latency is roughly equal to a series of
        calls to individual mutate methods, where each change in
        resource type is a new call. For example, mutating 10 campaigns
        then 10 ad groups is like 2 calls, while mutating 1 campaign, 1
        ad group, 1 campaign, 1 ad group is like 4 calls.
