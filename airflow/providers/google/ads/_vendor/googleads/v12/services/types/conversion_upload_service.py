            return errors. If false, all operations will be
            carried out in one transaction if and only if
            they are all valid. This should always be set to
            true.

            https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/best-practices/partial-failures

        validate_only (bool):
            If true, the request is validated but not
            executed. Only errors are returned, not results.
        debug_enabled (bool):
            If true, the API will perform all upload checks and return
            errors if any are found. If false, it will perform only
            basic input validation, skip subsequent upload checks, and
            return success even if no click was found for the provided
            ``user_identifiers``.

            This setting only affects Enhanced conversions for leads
            uploads that use ``user_identifiers`` instead of ``GCLID``,
            ``GBRAID``, or ``WBRAID``. When uploading enhanced
            conversions for leads, you should upload all conversion
            events to the API, including those that may not come from
            Google Ads campaigns. The upload of an event that is not
            from a Google Ads campaign will result in a
            ``CLICK_NOT_FOUND`` error if this field is set to ``true``.
            Since these errors are expected for such events, set this
            field to ``false`` so you can confirm your uploads are
            properly formatted but ignore ``CLICK_NOT_FOUND`` errors
            from all of the conversions that are not from a Google Ads
            campaign. This will allow you to focus only on errors that
            you can address.

            Default is false.
