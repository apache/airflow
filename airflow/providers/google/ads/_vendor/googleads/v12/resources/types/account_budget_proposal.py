class AccountBudgetProposal(proto.Message):
    r"""An account-level budget proposal.

    All fields prefixed with 'proposed' may not necessarily be applied
    directly. For example, proposed spending limits may be adjusted
    before their application. This is true if the 'proposed' field has
    an 'approved' counterpart, for example, spending limits.

    Note that the proposal type (proposal_type) changes which fields are
    required and which must remain empty.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.
