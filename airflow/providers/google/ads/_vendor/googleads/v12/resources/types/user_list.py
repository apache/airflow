class UserList(proto.Message):
    r"""A user list. This is a list of users a customer may target.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the user list. User list
            resource names have the form:

        id (int):
            Output only. Id of the user list.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        read_only (bool):
            Output only. An option that indicates if a
            user may edit a list. Depends on the list
            ownership and list type. For example, external
            remarketing user lists are not editable.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_read_only``.
        name (str):
            Name of this user list. Depending on its access_reason, the
            user list name may not be unique (for example, if
            access_reason=SHARED)

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        description (str):
            Description of this user list.

            Membership status of this user list.
            Indicates whether a user list is open or active.
            Only open user lists can accumulate more users
            and can be targeted to.
        integration_code (str):
            An ID from external system. It is used by
            user list sellers to correlate IDs on their
            systems.

        membership_life_span (int):
            Number of days a user's cookie stays on your list since its
            most recent addition to the list. This field must be between
            0 and 540 inclusive. However, for CRM based userlists, this
            field can be set to 10000 which means no expiration.
