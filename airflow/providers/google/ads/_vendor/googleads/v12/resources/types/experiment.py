class Experiment(proto.Message):
    r"""A Google ads experiment for users to experiment changes on
    multiple campaigns, compare the performance, and apply the
    effective changes.

    Attributes:
        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the experiment. Experiment
            resource names have the form:

            ``customers/{customer_id}/experiments/{experiment_id}``
        experiment_id (int):
            Output only. The ID of the experiment. Read
            only.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_experiment_id``.
        name (str):
            Required. The name of the experiment. It must
            have a minimum length of 1 and maximum length of
            1024. It must be unique under a customer.
        description (str):
            The description of the experiment. It must
            have a minimum length of 1 and maximum length of
            2048.
        suffix (str):
            For system managed experiments, the
            advertiser must provide a suffix during
            construction, in the setup stage before moving
            to initiated. The suffix will be appended to the
            in-design and experiment campaign names so that
            the name is base campaign name + suffix.
        type_ (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.ExperimentTypeEnum.ExperimentType):
            Required. The product/feature that uses this
            experiment.
        status (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.ExperimentStatusEnum.ExperimentStatus):
            The Advertiser-chosen status of this
            experiment.
        start_date (str):
            Date when the experiment starts. By default,
            the experiment starts now or on the campaign's
            start date, whichever is later. If this field is
            set, then the experiment starts at the beginning
            of the specified date in the customer's time
            zone.

            Format: YYYY-MM-DD
            Example: 2019-03-14

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_start_date``.
        end_date (str):
            Date when the experiment ends. By default,
            the experiment ends on the campaign's end date.
            If this field is set, then the experiment ends
            at the end of the specified date in the
            customer's time zone.
            Format: YYYY-MM-DD
            Example: 2019-04-18

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_end_date``.
        goals (Sequence[google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.MetricGoal]):
            The goals of this experiment.
        long_running_operation (str):
            Output only. The resource name of the
            long-running operation that can be used to poll
            for completion of experiment schedule or
            promote. The most recent long running operation
            is returned.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_long_running_operation``.
        promote_status (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.AsyncActionStatusEnum.AsyncActionStatus):
            Output only. The status of the experiment
            promotion process.
