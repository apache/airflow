        type_ (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.SharedSetTypeEnum.SharedSetType):
            Immutable. The type of this shared set: each

            Required. Immutable.
        name (str):
            The name of this shared set. Required.
            Shared Sets must have names that are unique
            among active shared sets of the same type.
