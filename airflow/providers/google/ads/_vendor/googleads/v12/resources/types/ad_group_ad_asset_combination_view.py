    Attributes:
        resource_name (str):
            Output only. The resource name of the ad group ad asset
            combination view. The combination ID is 128 bits long, where
            the upper 64 bits are stored in asset_combination_id_high,
            and the lower 64 bits are stored in
            asset_combination_id_low. AdGroupAd Asset Combination view

            true, the asset combination is linked to the
            latest version of the ad. If false, it means the
            link once existed but has been removed and is no
            longer present in the latest version of the ad.
