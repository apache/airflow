class BiddingStrategy(proto.Message):
    r"""A bidding strategy.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        resource_name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the bidding strategy.
            Bidding strategy resource names have the form:

            ``customers/{customer_id}/biddingStrategies/{bidding_strategy_id}``
        id (int):
            Output only. The ID of the bidding strategy.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_id``.
        name (str):
            The name of the bidding strategy.
            All bidding strategies within an account must be
            named distinctly.
            The length of this string should be between 1
            and 255, inclusive, in UTF-8 bytes, (trimmed).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_name``.
        status (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.BiddingStrategyStatusEnum.BiddingStrategyStatus):
            Output only. The status of the bidding
            strategy.
            This field is read-only.
        type_ (google.ads.googleads.v12.enums.types.BiddingStrategyTypeEnum.BiddingStrategyType):
            Output only. The type of the bidding
            strategy. Create a bidding strategy by setting
            the bidding scheme.
            This field is read-only.
        currency_code (str):
            Immutable. The currency used by the bidding strategy (ISO
            4217 three-letter code).

            For bidding strategies in manager customers, this currency
            can be set on creation and defaults to the manager
            customer's currency. For serving customers, this field
            cannot be set; all strategies in a serving customer
            implicitly use the serving customer's currency. In all cases
            the effective_currency_code field returns the currency used
            by the strategy.
        effective_currency_code (str):
            Output only. The currency used by the bidding strategy (ISO
            4217 three-letter code).

            For bidding strategies in manager customers, this is the
            currency set by the advertiser when creating the strategy.
            For serving customers, this is the customer's currency_code.

            Bidding strategy metrics are reported in this currency.

            This field is read-only.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_effective_currency_code``.
        aligned_campaign_budget_id (int):
            ID of the campaign budget that this portfolio
            bidding strategy is aligned with. When a
            portfolio and a campaign budget are aligned,
            that means that they are attached to the same
            set of campaigns. After a bidding strategy is
            aligned with a campaign budget, campaigns that
            are added to the bidding strategy must also use
            the aligned campaign budget.
        campaign_count (int):
            Output only. The number of campaigns attached
            to this bidding strategy.
            This field is read-only.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_campaign_count``.
        non_removed_campaign_count (int):
            Output only. The number of non-removed
            campaigns attached to this bidding strategy.
            This field is read-only.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_non_removed_campaign_count``.
        enhanced_cpc (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.EnhancedCpc):
            A bidding strategy that raises bids for
            clicks that seem more likely to lead to a
            conversion and lowers them for clicks where they
            seem less likely.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        maximize_conversion_value (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.MaximizeConversionValue):
            An automated bidding strategy to help get the
            most conversion value for your campaigns while
            spending your budget.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        maximize_conversions (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.MaximizeConversions):
            An automated bidding strategy to help get the
            most conversions for your campaigns while
            spending your budget.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        target_cpa (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.TargetCpa):
            A bidding strategy that sets bids to help get
            as many conversions as possible at the target
            cost-per-acquisition (CPA) you set.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        target_impression_share (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.TargetImpressionShare):
            A bidding strategy that automatically
            optimizes towards a chosen percentage of
            impressions.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        target_roas (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.TargetRoas):
            A bidding strategy that helps you maximize
            revenue while averaging a specific target Return
            On Ad Spend (ROAS).

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
        target_spend (google.ads.googleads.v12.common.types.TargetSpend):
            A bid strategy that sets your bids to help
            get as many clicks as possible within your
            budget.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``scheme``.
