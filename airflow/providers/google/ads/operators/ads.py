class GoogleAdsListAccountsOperator(BaseOperator):
    """
    Saves list of customers on GCS in form of a csv file.

    The resulting list of customers is based on your OAuth credentials. The request returns a list
    of all accounts that you are able to act upon directly given your current credentials. This will
    not necessarily include all accounts within the account hierarchy; rather, it will only include
    accounts where your authenticated user has been added with admin or other rights in the account.

        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
