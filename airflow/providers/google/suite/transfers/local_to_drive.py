    Upload a list of files to a Google Drive folder.
    This operator uploads a list of local files to a Google Drive folder.
    The local files can be deleted after upload (optional)

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:LocalFilesystemToGoogleDriveOperator`

    :param local_paths: Python list of local file paths
    :param drive_folder: path of the Drive folder, if folder_id param is given then drive_folder is a
        sub path of folder_id.
    :param gcp_conn_id: Airflow Connection ID for GCP
    :param delete: should the local files be deleted after upload?
    :param ignore_if_missing: if True, then don't fail even if all files
        can't be uploaded.
    :param chunk_size: File will be uploaded in chunks of this many bytes. Only
        used if resumable=True. Pass in a value of -1 if the file is to be
        uploaded as a single chunk. Note that Google App Engine has a 5MB limit
        on request size, so you should never set your chunk size larger than 5MB,
        or to -1.
    :param resumable: True if this is a resumable upload. False means upload
        in a single request.
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
        if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
        domain-wide delegation enabled.
    :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
        credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account
    :param folder_id: The base/root folder id for each local path in the Drive folder
    :param show_full_target_path: If true then it reveals full available file path in the logs.
    :return: Remote file ids after upload
