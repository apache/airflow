    Wrap the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job; requires "spark-submit" binary in the PATH.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:SparkSubmitOperator`

    :param application: The application that submitted as a job, either jar or py file. (templated)
    :param conf: Arbitrary Spark configuration properties (templated)
    :param conn_id: The :ref:`spark connection id <howto/connection:spark-submit>` as configured
        in Airflow administration. When an invalid connection_id is supplied, it will default to yarn.
    :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
                  comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.
                  For example, serialized objects. (templated)
    :param py_files: Additional python files used by the job, can be .zip, .egg or .py. (templated)
    :param jars: Submit additional jars to upload and place them in executor classpath. (templated)
    :param driver_class_path: Additional, driver-specific, classpath settings. (templated)
    :param java_class: the main class of the Java application
    :param packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to include on the
                     driver and executor classpaths. (templated)
    :param exclude_packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to exclude
                             while resolving the dependencies provided in 'packages' (templated)
    :param repositories: Comma-separated list of additional remote repositories to search
                         for the maven coordinates given with 'packages'
    :param total_executor_cores: (Standalone & Mesos only) Total cores for all executors
                                 (Default: all the available cores on the worker)
    :param executor_cores: (Standalone & YARN only) Number of cores per executor (Default: 2)
    :param executor_memory: Memory per executor (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
    :param driver_memory: Memory allocated to the driver (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
    :param keytab: Full path to the file that contains the keytab (templated)
    :param principal: The name of the kerberos principal used for keytab (templated)
    :param proxy_user: User to impersonate when submitting the application (templated)
    :param name: Name of the job (default airflow-spark). (templated)
    :param num_executors: Number of executors to launch
    :param status_poll_interval: Seconds to wait between polls of driver status in cluster
        mode (Default: 1)
    :param application_args: Arguments for the application being submitted (templated)
    :param env_vars: Environment variables for spark-submit. It supports yarn and k8s mode too. (templated)
    :param verbose: Whether to pass the verbose flag to spark-submit process for debugging
    :param spark_binary: The command to use for spark submit.
                         Some distros may use spark2-submit or spark3-submit.
                         (will overwrite any spark_binary defined in the connection's extra JSON)
    :param properties_file: Path to a file from which to load extra properties. If not
                              specified, this will look for conf/spark-defaults.conf.
    :param yarn_queue: The name of the YARN queue to which the application is submitted.
                        (will overwrite any yarn queue defined in the connection's extra JSON)
    :param deploy_mode: Whether to deploy your driver on the worker nodes (cluster) or locally as a client.
                        (will overwrite any deployment mode defined in the connection's extra JSON)
    :param use_krb5ccache: if True, configure spark to use ticket cache instead of relying
                           on keytab for Kerberos login
