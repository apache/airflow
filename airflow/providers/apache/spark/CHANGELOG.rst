~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``spark-binary`` connection extra could be set to any binary, but with 4.0.0 version only two values
are allowed for it ``spark-submit`` and ``spark2-submit``.

PATH in order to use SparkSubmitHook and SparkSubmitOperator.

   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
