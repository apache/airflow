    Checks for the existence of a record in a Cassandra cluster.

        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:CassandraRecordSensor`

    For example, if you want to wait for a record that has values 'v1' and 'v2' for each
    primary keys 'p1' and 'p2' to be populated in keyspace 'k' and table 't',
    instantiate it as follows:

    >>> cassandra_sensor = CassandraRecordSensor(table="k.t",
    ...                                          keys={"p1": "v1", "p2": "v2"},
    ...                                          cassandra_conn_id="cassandra_default",
    ...                                          task_id="cassandra_sensor")

    :param table: Target Cassandra table.
        Use dot notation to target a specific keyspace.
    :type table: str
    :param keys: The keys and their values to be monitored
    :type keys: dict
    :param cassandra_conn_id: The connection ID to use
        when connecting to Cassandra cluster
    :type cassandra_conn_id: str
