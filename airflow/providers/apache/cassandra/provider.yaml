# Cassandra provider is not yet compatible with Python 3.12
# The main issue is that python cassandra driver by default uses asyncore which has been deprecated since
# Python 3.6 and removed in Python 3.12 (https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asyncore.html)
#
# Currently the "wheel" package 3.29.0 distributed for manylinux platform is build without libev support (
# which could be a viable asyncore replacement), and cassandra driver works in Python 3.12 if it is built
# with libev support (using sdist, having gcc, libev4 and libev-dev installed). But it would be too much to
# expect our users to build the driver from sources to use it with Python 3.12, so we are waiting for the
# next release of cassandra-driver which will have libev support in the wheel package.
# The issue is tracked here https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-1378
#
# Another option to get cassandra drive back is to have asyncio support in the driver instead of asyncore:
# The issue is tracked here: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-1375 and is scheduled
# to be fixed in cassandra-driver 3.30.0.
#
# All Cassandra tests are automatically skipped if cassandra package is not present, so once you remove the
# exclusion, they will start running for Python 3.12.
