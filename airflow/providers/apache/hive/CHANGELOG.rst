4.0.0
.....

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``hql`` parameter in ``get_records`` of ``HiveServer2Hook`` has been renamed to sql to match the
  ``get_records`` DbApiHook signature. If you used it as a positional parameter, this is no change for you,
  but if you used it as keyword one, you need to rename it.
* ``hive_conf`` parameter has been renamed to ``parameters`` and it is now second parameter, to match ``get_records``
  signature from the DbApiHook. You need to rename it if you used it.
* ``schema`` parameter in ``get_records`` is an optional kwargs extra parameter that you can add, to match
  the schema of ``get_records`` from DbApiHook.

* ``Deprecate hql parameters and synchronize DBApiHook method APIs (#25299)``
* ``Remove Smart Sensors (#25507)``
