    Every Iceberg commit performed by the sink includes some snapshot
    summary properties. As mentioned above, one such property is the
    control topic offsets. Another is the unique UUID assigned to every
    commit. Finally, there is a VTTS (valid-through timestamp) property
    indicating through what timestamp records have been fully processed,
    i.e. all records processed from then on will have a timestamp greater
    than the VTTS. This is calculated by taking the maximum timestamp of
    records processed from each topic partition, and taking the minimum of
    these. If any partitions were not processed as part of the commit then
    the VTTS is not set.
