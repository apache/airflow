  `Apache Airflow providers support policy <https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst#minimum-supported-version-of-airflow-for-community-managed-providers>`_.

.. note::
  In PR #34790 we removed the unused argument ``metadata`` from method ``es_read``.  We determined that ``es_read``
  is an internal method and therefore not subject to backcompat, so we did not bump major version for this provider.
  In order to make clearer that this is an internal method we renamed it with an underscore prefix ``_es_read``.

5.0.0
.....

.. note::
  Upgrade to Elasticsearch 8. The ElasticsearchTaskHandler & ElasticsearchSQLHook will now use Elasticsearch 8 package.
  As explained https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable , Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards
  compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made, we recommend upgrading the version of
  Elasticsearch database to 8 to ensure compatibility with the language client.

2.0.1
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``
* ``Remove support Jinja templated log_id in Elasticsearch (#16465)``

  While undocumented, previously ``[elasticsearch] log_id`` supported a Jinja templated string.
  Support for Jinja templates has now been removed. ``log_id`` should be a template string instead,
  for example: ``{dag_id}-{task_id}-{execution_date}-{try_number}``.

  If you used a Jinja template previously, the ``execution_date`` on your Elasticsearch documents will need
  to be updated to the new format.

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.
