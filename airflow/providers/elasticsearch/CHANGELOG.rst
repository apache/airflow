.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Auto-apply apply_default decorator (#15667)``
* ``Remove support Jinja templated log_id in Elasticsearch (#16465)``

  While undocumented, previously ``[elasticsearch] log_id`` supported a Jinja templated string.
  Support for Jinja templates has now been removed. ``log_id`` should be a template string instead,
  for example: ``{dag_id}-{task_id}-{execution_date}-{try_number}``.

  If you used a Jinja template previously, the ``execution_date`` on your Elasticsearch documents will need
  to be updated to the new format.

.. warning:: Due to apply_default decorator removal, this version of the provider requires Airflow 2.1.0+.
   If your Airflow version is < 2.1.0, and you want to install this provider version, first upgrade
   Airflow to at least version 2.1.0. Otherwise your Airflow package version will be upgraded
   automatically and you will have to manually run ``airflow upgrade db`` to complete the migration.
