  # We cannot use elasticsearch 8 yet. The elasticsearch-dsl is not compatible with it.
  # elasticsearch>=7.15.0 breaks our tests.The eleasticsearch 7 is an old version that is not
  # supported anymore. We should move to elasticsearch 8 as
  # likely requires getting rid of elasticsearch-dsl or waiting until there is a compatible version
  # We can also try to replace the <7.15.0 with <8.0.0 but we need to solve the test failures first
  - elasticsearch>7,<7.15.0
