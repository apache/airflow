    Normalize content or all values of content if it is a dict to a string.

    The function will throw if content contains non-string or non-numeric non-boolean

    must be a dict with only string values. This is because ``render_template`` will
    fail for numerical values.

    The only one exception is when we have boolean values, they can not be converted
    to string type because databricks does not understand 'True' or 'False' values.
