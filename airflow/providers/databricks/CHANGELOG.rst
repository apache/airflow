Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DatabricksSqlHook`` is now conforming to the same semantics as all the other ``DBApiHook``
implementations and returns the same kind of response in its ``run`` method. Previously (pre 4.* versions
of the provider, the Hook returned Tuple of ("cursor description", "results") which was not compatible
with other DBApiHooks that return just "results". After this change (and dependency on common.sql >= 1.3.1),
The ``DatabricksSqlHook`` returns now "results" only. The ``description`` can be retrieved via
``last_description`` field of the hook after ``run`` method completes.

That makes the ``DatabricksSqlHook`` suitable for generic SQL operator and detailed lineage analysis.

If you had custom hooks or used the Hook in your TaskFlow code or custom operators that relied on this
behaviour, you need to adapt your DAGs.

The Databricks ``DatabricksSQLOperator`` is also more standard and derives from common
``SQLExecuteQueryOperator`` and uses more consistent approach to process output when SQL queries are run.
However in this case the result returned by ``execute`` method is unchanged (it still returns Tuple of
("description", "results") and this Tuple is pushed to XCom, so your DAGs relying on this behaviour
should continue working without any change.
