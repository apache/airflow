4.0.0
.....

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
  This version introduce a new way to handle the connection to Airbyte using ``client_id`` and ``client_secret`` instead of ``login`` and ``password``.
  You can get them accessing the Airbyte UI and creating a new Application in the Settings page.

  There is a large refactor to create a connection.
  You must specify the Full Qualified Domain Name in the ``host`` parameter, eg: ``https://my.company:8000/airbyte/v1/``.
  The ``token_url`` parameter is optional and it is used to create the access token, the default value is ``v1/applications/token`` used by Airbyte Cloud.
  You must remove the ``api_type`` parameter from your DAG it isn't required anymore.
