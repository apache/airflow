  # The Asana provider uses Asana Python API https://github.com/Asana/python-asana/ and version
  # 4.* of it introduced 31.07.2023 is heavily incompatible with previous versions
  # (new way of generating API client from specification has been used). Until we convert to the new API
  # - as described in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32994 - we need to limit the version to < 4.
