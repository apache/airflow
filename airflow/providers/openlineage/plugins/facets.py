    Composite Airflow job facet.

    This facet encapsulates all the necessary information to re-create full scope of an Airflow DAG logic,
    enabling reconstruction, visualization, and analysis of DAGs in a comprehensive manner.
    It includes detailed representations of the tasks, task groups, and their hierarchical relationships,
    making it possible to draw a graph that visually represents the entire DAG structure (like in Airflow UI).
    It also indicates whether a task should emit an OpenLineage (OL) event, enabling consumers to anticipate
    the number of events and identify the tasks from which they can expect these events.

    Attributes:
        taskTree: A dictionary representing the hierarchical structure of tasks in the DAG.
        taskGroups: A dictionary that contains information about task groups within the DAG.
        tasks: A dictionary detailing individual tasks within the DAG.

    did not emit events, which can occur due to the use of control flow operators like the BranchOperator.
