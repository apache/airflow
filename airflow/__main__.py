# The configuration module initializes and validates the conf object as a side effect the first
# time it is imported. If it is not imported before importing the settings module, the conf
# object will then be initted/validated as a side effect of it being imported in settings,
# however this can cause issues since those modules are very tightly coupled and can
# very easily cause import cycles in the conf init/validate code (since downstream code from
# those functions likely import settings).
# Therefore importing configuration early (as the first airflow import) avoids
# any possible import cycles with settings downstream.
