LocalExecutor runs tasks by spawning processes in a controlled fashion in different
modes. Given that BaseExecutor has the option to receive a `parallelism` parameter to
limit the number of process spawned, when this parameter is `0` the number of processes
that LocalExecutor can spawn is unlimited.

The following strategies are implemented:
1. Unlimited Parallelism (self.parallelism == 0): In this strategy, LocalExecutor will
spawn a process every time `execute_async` is called, that is, every task submitted to the
LocalExecutor will be executed in its own process. Once the task is executed and the
result stored in the `result_queue`, the process terminates. There is no need for a
`task_queue` in this approach, since as soon as a task is received a new process will be
allocated to the task. Processes used in this strategy are of class LocalWorker.

2. Limited Parallelism (self.parallelism > 0): In this strategy, the LocalExecutor spawns
the number of processes equal to the value of `self.parallelism` at `start` time,
using a `task_queue` to coordinate the ingestion of tasks and the work distribution among
the workers, which will take a task as soon as they are ready. During the lifecycle of
the LocalExecutor, the worker processes are running waiting for tasks, once the
LocalExecutor receives the call to shutdown the executor a poison token is sent to the
workers to terminate them. Processes used in this strategy are of class QueuedLocalWorker.

Arguably, `SequentialExecutor` could be thought as a LocalExecutor with limited
parallelism of just 1 worker, i.e. `self.parallelism = 1`.
This option could lead to the unification of the executor implementations, running
locally, into just one `LocalExecutor` with multiple modes.
