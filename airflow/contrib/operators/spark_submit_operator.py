    This hook is a wrapper around the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job.
    It requires that the "spark-submit" binary is in the PATH or the spark-home is set
    in the extra on the connection.

    :type conn_id: str
    :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
                  comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.

    :param exclude_packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to exclude
                             while resolving the dependencies provided in 'packages' (templated)
    :type exclude_packages: str

    :param executor_cores: (Standalone & YARN only) Number of cores per executor (Default: 2)
    :type executor_cores: int
    :param executor_memory: Memory per executor (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
    :type executor_memory: str
