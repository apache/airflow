    List all objects from the bucket with the give string prefix and delimiter in name.

    This operator returns a python list with the name of objects which can be used by
     `xcom` in the downstream task.

    :param bucket: The Google cloud storage bucket to find the objects.
    :type bucket: string
    :param prefix: Prefix string which filters objects whose name begin with this prefix
    :type prefix: string
    :param delimiter: The delimiter by which you want to filter the objects.
        For e.g to lists the CSV files from in a directory in GCS you would use
        delimiter='.csv'.
    :type delimiter: string
    :param google_cloud_storage_conn_id: The connection ID to use when
        connecting to Google cloud storage.
    :type google_cloud_storage_conn_id: string
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate, if any.
        For this to work, the service account making the request must have
        domain-wide delegation enabled.
    :type delegate_to: string

    **Example**:
        The following Operator would list all the Avro files from ``sales/sales-2017``
        folder in ``data`` bucket. ::
