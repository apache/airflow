    """
    Creates a new bucket. Google Cloud Storage uses a flat namespace,
    so you can't create a bucket with a name that is already in use.

        .. seealso::
            For more information, see Bucket Naming Guidelines:
            https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucketnaming.html#requirements

    :param bucket_name: The name of the bucket. (templated)
    :type bucket_name: str
    :param resource: An optional dict with parameters for creating the bucket.
            For information on available parameters, see Cloud Storage API doc:
            https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets/insert
    :type resource: dict
    :param storage_class: This defines how objects in the bucket are stored
            and determines the SLA and the cost of storage (templated). Values include

            - ``MULTI_REGIONAL``
            - ``REGIONAL``
            - ``STANDARD``
            - ``NEARLINE``
            - ``COLDLINE``.

            If this value is not specified when the bucket is
            created, it will default to STANDARD.
    :type storage_class: str
    :param location: The location of the bucket. (templated)
        Object data for objects in the bucket resides in physical storage
        within this region. Defaults to US.

        .. seealso:: https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-locations

    :type location: str
    :param project_id: The ID of the GCP Project. (templated)
    :type project_id: str
    :param labels: User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
    :type labels: dict
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud Platform.
    :type gcp_conn_id: str
    :param google_cloud_storage_conn_id: (Deprecated) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud
        Platform. This parameter has been deprecated. You should pass the gcp_conn_id parameter instead.
    :type google_cloud_storage_conn_id: str
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate, if any.
        For this to work, the service account making the request must
        have domain-wide delegation enabled.
    :type delegate_to: str

    with ``MULTI_REGIONAL`` storage class in ``EU`` region
