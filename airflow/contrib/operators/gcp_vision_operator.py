        `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/products/PRODUCT_ID` is necessary.

    You can provide the `name` directly as an attribute of the `product` object. However, you can leave it
    blank and provide `location` and `product_id` instead (and optionally `project_id` - if not present,
    the connection default will be used) and the `name` will be created by the operator itself.

    This mechanism exists for your convenience, to allow leaving the `project_id` empty and having Airflow
    use the connection default `project_id`.

    Possible errors related to the provided `Product`:

    - Returns `NOT_FOUND` if the Product does not exist.
    - Returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if `display_name` is present in update_mask but is missing from the request
        or longer than 4096 characters.
    - Returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if `description` is present in update_mask but is longer than 4096
        characters.
    - Returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if `product_category` is present in update_mask.
