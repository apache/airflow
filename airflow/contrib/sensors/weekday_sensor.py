    Waits until the first specified day of the week. For example, if the execution
    day of the task is '2018-12-22' (Saturday) and you pass 'FRIDAY', the task will wait
    until next Friday.

    **Example** (with single day): ::

        weekend_check = DayOfWeekSensor(
            task_id='weekend_check',
            week_day='Saturday',
            use_task_execution_day=True,

        weekend_check = DayOfWeekSensor(
            task_id='weekend_check',
            week_day={'Saturday', 'Sunday'},
            use_task_execution_day=True,
            dag=dag)

    **Example** (with :class:`~airflow.contrib.utils.weekday.WeekDay` enum): ::

            use_task_execution_day=True,
            dag=dag)

    :param week_day: Day of the week to check (full name). Optionally, a set
        of days can also be provided using a set.
        Example values:

            * ``"MONDAY"``,
            * ``{"Saturday", "Sunday"}``
            * ``{WeekDay.TUESDAY}``
            * ``{WeekDay.SATURDAY, WeekDay.SUNDAY}``

    :type week_day: set or str or airflow.contrib.utils.weekday.WeekDay
    :param use_task_execution_day: If ``True``, uses task's execution day to compare
        with week_day. Execution Date is Useful for backfilling.
        If ``False``, uses system's day of the week. Useful when you
        don't want to run anything on weekdays on the system.
