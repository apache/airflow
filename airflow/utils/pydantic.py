# This is an util module that makes Pydantic use optional. While we are using Pydantic in the airflow core
# codebase, we don't want to make it a hard dependency for all the users of the core codebase, because
# it is only used in the serialization and deserialization of the models for Internal API and for nothing
# else, and since Pydantic is a very popular library, we don't want to force the users of the core codebase
# to install specific Pydantic version - especially that a lot of libraries out there still depend on
# Pydantic 1 and our internal API uses Pydantic 2+
