class DepContext:
    """
    A base class for contexts that specifies which dependencies should be evaluated in
    the context for a task instance to satisfy the requirements of the context. Also
    stores state related to the context that can be used by dependency classes.

    For example there could be a SomeRunContext that subclasses this class which has
    dependencies for:

    - Making sure there are slots available on the infrastructure to run the task instance
    - A task-instance's task-specific dependencies are met (e.g. the previous task
      instance completed successfully)
    - ...

    :param deps: The context-specific dependencies that need to be evaluated for a
        task instance to run in this execution context.
    :param flag_upstream_failed: This is a hack to generate the upstream_failed state
        creation while checking to see whether the task instance is runnable. It was the
        shortest path to add the feature. This is bad since this class should be pure (no
        side effects).
    :param ignore_all_deps: Whether or not the context should ignore all ignorable
        dependencies. Overrides the other ignore_* parameters
    :param ignore_depends_on_past: Ignore depends_on_past parameter of DAGs (e.g. for
        Backfills)
    :param ignore_in_retry_period: Ignore the retry period for task instances
    :param ignore_in_reschedule_period: Ignore the reschedule period for task instances
    :param ignore_unmapped_tasks: Ignore errors about mapped tasks not yet being expanded
    :param ignore_task_deps: Ignore task-specific dependencies such as depends_on_past and
        trigger rule
    :param ignore_ti_state: Ignore the task instance's previous failure/success
    :param finished_tis: A list of all the finished task instances of this run
