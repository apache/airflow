class DepContext(object):
    """
    A base class for contexts that specifies which dependencies should be evaluated in
    the context for a task instance to satisfy the requirements of the context. Also
    stores state related to the context that can be used by dependendency classes.

    For example there could be a SomeRunContext that subclasses this class which has
    dependencies for:
    - Making sure there are slots available on the infrastructure to run the task instance
    - A task-instance's task-specific dependencies are met (e.g. the previous task
      instance completed successfully)
    - ...

    :param deps: The context-specific dependencies that need to be evaluated for a
        task instance to run in this execution context.
    :type deps: set(BaseTIDep)
    :param flag_upstream_failed: This is a hack to generate the upstream_failed state
        creation while checking to see whether the task instance is runnable. It was the
        shortest path to add the feature. This is bad since this class should be pure (no
        side effects).
    :type flag_upstream_failed: boolean
    :param ignore_all_deps: Whether or not the context should ignore all ignoreable
        dependencies. Overrides the other ignore_* parameters
    :type ignore_all_deps: boolean
    :param ignore_depends_on_past: Ignore depends_on_past parameter of DAGs (e.g. for
        Backfills)
    :type ignore_depends_on_past: boolean
    :param ignore_in_retry_period: Ignore the retry period for task instances
    :type ignore_in_retry_period: boolean
    :param ignore_task_deps: Ignore task-specific dependencies such as depends_on_past and
        trigger rule
    :type ignore_task_deps: boolean
    :param ignore_ti_state: Ignore the task instance's previous failure/success
