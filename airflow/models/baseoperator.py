class BaseOperator(TaskSDKBaseOperator, AbstractOperator, metaclass=BaseOperatorMeta):
    r"""
    Abstract base class for all operators.

    Since operators create objects that become nodes in the DAG, BaseOperator
    contains many recursive methods for DAG crawling behavior. To derive from
    this class, you are expected to override the constructor and the 'execute'
    method.

    Operators derived from this class should perform or trigger certain tasks
    synchronously (wait for completion). Example of operators could be an
    operator that runs a Pig job (PigOperator), a sensor operator that
    waits for a partition to land in Hive (HiveSensorOperator), or one that
    moves data from Hive to MySQL (Hive2MySqlOperator). Instances of these
    operators (tasks) target specific operations, running specific scripts,
    functions or data transfers.

    This class is abstract and shouldn't be instantiated. Instantiating a
    class derived from this one results in the creation of a task object,
    which ultimately becomes a node in DAG objects. Task dependencies should
    be set by using the set_upstream and/or set_downstream methods.

    :param task_id: a unique, meaningful id for the task
    :param owner: the owner of the task. Using a meaningful description
        (e.g. user/person/team/role name) to clarify ownership is recommended.
    :param email: the 'to' email address(es) used in email alerts. This can be a
        single email or multiple ones. Multiple addresses can be specified as a
        comma or semicolon separated string or by passing a list of strings.
    :param email_on_retry: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when a
        task is retried
    :param email_on_failure: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when
        a task failed
    :param retries: the number of retries that should be performed before
        failing the task
    :param retry_delay: delay between retries, can be set as ``timedelta`` or
        ``float`` seconds, which will be converted into ``timedelta``,
        the default is ``timedelta(seconds=300)``.
    :param retry_exponential_backoff: allow progressively longer waits between
        retries by using exponential backoff algorithm on retry delay (delay
        will be converted into seconds)
    :param max_retry_delay: maximum delay interval between retries, can be set as
        ``timedelta`` or ``float`` seconds, which will be converted into ``timedelta``.
    :param start_date: The ``start_date`` for the task, determines
        the ``logical_date`` for the first task instance. The best practice
        is to have the start_date rounded
        to your DAG's schedule. Daily jobs have their start_date
        some day at 00:00:00, hourly jobs have their start_date at 00:00
        of a specific hour. Note that Airflow simply looks at the latest
        ``logical_date`` and adds the schedule to determine
        the next ``logical_date``. It is also very important
        to note that different tasks' dependencies
        need to line up in time. If task A depends on task B and their
        start_date are offset in a way that their logical_date don't line
        up, A's dependencies will never be met. If you are looking to delay
        a task, for example running a daily task at 2AM, look into the
        ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor``. We advise against using
        dynamic ``start_date`` and recommend using fixed ones. Read the
        FAQ entry about start_date for more information.
    :param end_date: if specified, the scheduler won't go beyond this date
    :param depends_on_past: when set to true, task instances will run
        sequentially and only if the previous instance has succeeded or has been skipped.
        The task instance for the start_date is allowed to run.
    :param wait_for_past_depends_before_skipping: when set to true, if the task instance
        should be marked as skipped, and depends_on_past is true, the ti will stay on None state
        waiting the task of the previous run
    :param wait_for_downstream: when set to true, an instance of task
        X will wait for tasks immediately downstream of the previous instance
        of task X to finish successfully or be skipped before it runs. This is useful if the
        different instances of a task X alter the same asset, and this asset
        is used by tasks downstream of task X. Note that depends_on_past
        is forced to True wherever wait_for_downstream is used. Also note that
        only tasks *immediately* downstream of the previous task instance are waited
        for; the statuses of any tasks further downstream are ignored.
    :param dag: a reference to the dag the task is attached to (if any)
    :param priority_weight: priority weight of this task against other task.
        This allows the executor to trigger higher priority tasks before
        others when things get backed up. Set priority_weight as a higher
        number for more important tasks.
        As not all database engines support 64-bit integers, values are capped with 32-bit.
        Valid range is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
    :param weight_rule: weighting method used for the effective total
        priority weight of the task. Options are:
        ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream``
        When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the
        aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream
        tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively
        when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have
        multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to
        complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing
        downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the
        aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where
        downstream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more
        aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you
        have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete
        before starting upstream tasks of other dags.  When set to
        ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight``
        specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when
        you know exactly what priority weight each task should have.
        Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of
        significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large
        DAGs. Options can be set as string or using the constants defined in
        the static class ``airflow.utils.WeightRule``.
        Irrespective of the weight rule, resulting priority values are capped with 32-bit.
        |experimental|
        Since 2.9.0, Airflow allows to define custom priority weight strategy,
        by creating a subclass of
        ``airflow.task.priority_strategy.PriorityWeightStrategy`` and registering
        in a plugin, then providing the class path or the class instance via
        ``weight_rule`` parameter. The custom priority weight strategy will be
        used to calculate the effective total priority weight of the task instance.
    :param queue: which queue to target when running this job. Not
        all executors implement queue management, the CeleryExecutor
        does support targeting specific queues.
    :param pool: the slot pool this task should run in, slot pools are a
        way to limit concurrency for certain tasks
    :param pool_slots: the number of pool slots this task should use (>= 1)
        Values less than 1 are not allowed.
    :param sla: DEPRECATED - The SLA feature is removed in Airflow 3.0, to be replaced with a new implementation in 3.1
    :param execution_timeout: max time allowed for the execution of
        this task instance, if it goes beyond it will raise and fail.
    :param on_failure_callback: a function or list of functions to be called when a task instance
        of this task fails. a context dictionary is passed as a single
        parameter to this function. Context contains references to related
        objects to the task instance and is documented under the macros
        section of the API.
    :param on_execute_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed right before the task is executed.
    :param on_retry_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed when retries occur.
    :param on_success_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed when the task succeeds.
    :param on_skipped_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
        that it is executed when skipped occur; this callback will be called only if AirflowSkipException get raised.
        Explicitly it is NOT called if a task is not started to be executed because of a preceding branching
        decision in the DAG or a trigger rule which causes execution to skip so that the task execution
        is never scheduled.
    :param pre_execute: a function to be called immediately before task
        execution, receiving a context dictionary; raising an exception will
        prevent the task from being executed.

        |experimental|
    :param post_execute: a function to be called immediately after task
        execution, receiving a context dictionary and task result; raising an
        exception will prevent the task from succeeding.

        |experimental|
    :param trigger_rule: defines the rule by which dependencies are applied
        for the task to get triggered. Options are:
        ``{ all_success | all_failed | all_done | all_skipped | one_success | one_done |
        one_failed | none_failed | none_failed_min_one_success | none_skipped | always}``
        default is ``all_success``. Options can be set as string or
        using the constants defined in the static class
        ``airflow.utils.TriggerRule``
    :param resources: A map of resource parameter names (the argument names of the
        Resources constructor) to their values.
    :param run_as_user: unix username to impersonate while running the task
    :param max_active_tis_per_dag: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
        runs across logical_dates.
    :param max_active_tis_per_dagrun: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
        task instances per DAG run.
    :param executor: Which executor to target when running this task. NOT YET SUPPORTED
    :param executor_config: Additional task-level configuration parameters that are
        interpreted by a specific executor. Parameters are namespaced by the name of
        executor.

        **Example**: to run this task in a specific docker container through
        the KubernetesExecutor ::

            MyOperator(..., executor_config={"KubernetesExecutor": {"image": "myCustomDockerImage"}})

    :param do_xcom_push: if True, an XCom is pushed containing the Operator's
        result
    :param multiple_outputs: if True and do_xcom_push is True, pushes multiple XComs, one for each
        key in the returned dictionary result. If False and do_xcom_push is True, pushes a single XCom.
    :param task_group: The TaskGroup to which the task should belong. This is typically provided when not
        using a TaskGroup as a context manager.
    :param doc: Add documentation or notes to your Task objects that is visible in
        Task Instance details View in the Webserver
    :param doc_md: Add documentation (in Markdown format) or notes to your Task objects
        that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
    :param doc_rst: Add documentation (in RST format) or notes to your Task objects
        that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
    :param doc_json: Add documentation (in JSON format) or notes to your Task objects
        that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
    :param doc_yaml: Add documentation (in YAML format) or notes to your Task objects
        that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
    :param task_display_name: The display name of the task which appears on the UI.
    :param logger_name: Name of the logger used by the Operator to emit logs.
        If set to `None` (default), the logger name will fall back to
        `airflow.task.operators.{class.__module__}.{class.__name__}` (e.g. SimpleHttpOperator will have
        *airflow.task.operators.airflow.providers.http.operators.http.SimpleHttpOperator* as logger).
    :param allow_nested_operators: if True, when an operator is executed within another one a warning message
        will be logged. If False, then an exception will be raised if the operator is badly used (e.g. nested
        within another one). In future releases of Airflow this parameter will be removed and an exception
        will always be thrown when operators are nested within each other (default is True).

        **Example**: example of a bad operator mixin usage::

            @task(provide_context=True)
            def say_hello_world(**context):
                hello_world_task = BashOperator(

    Given a number of tasks, builds a dependency chain.

    This function accepts values of BaseOperator (aka tasks), EdgeModifiers (aka Labels), XComArg, TaskGroups,
    or lists containing any mix of these types (or a mix in the same list). If you want to chain between two
    lists you must ensure they have the same length.

    Using classic operators/sensors:

    .. code-block:: python

        chain(t1, [t2, t3], [t4, t5], t6)

    is equivalent to::

          / -> t2 -> t4 \
        t1               -> t6
          \ -> t3 -> t5 /

    .. code-block:: python

        t1.set_downstream(t2)
        t1.set_downstream(t3)
        t2.set_downstream(t4)
        t3.set_downstream(t5)
        t4.set_downstream(t6)
        t5.set_downstream(t6)

    Using task-decorated functions aka XComArgs:

    .. code-block:: python

        chain(x1(), [x2(), x3()], [x4(), x5()], x6())

    is equivalent to::

          / -> x2 -> x4 \
        x1               -> x6
          \ -> x3 -> x5 /

    .. code-block:: python

        x1 = x1()
        x2 = x2()
        x3 = x3()
        x4 = x4()
        x5 = x5()
        x6 = x6()
        x1.set_downstream(x2)
        x1.set_downstream(x3)
        x2.set_downstream(x4)
        x3.set_downstream(x5)
        x4.set_downstream(x6)
        x5.set_downstream(x6)

    Using TaskGroups:

    .. code-block:: python

        chain(t1, task_group1, task_group2, t2)

        t1.set_downstream(task_group1)
        task_group1.set_downstream(task_group2)
        task_group2.set_downstream(t2)


    It is also possible to mix between classic operator/sensor, EdgeModifiers, XComArg, and TaskGroups:

    .. code-block:: python

        chain(t1, [Label("branch one"), Label("branch two")], [x1(), x2()], task_group1, x3())

    is equivalent to::

          / "branch one" -> x1 \
        t1                      -> task_group1 -> x3
          \ "branch two" -> x2 /

    .. code-block:: python

        x1 = x1()
        x2 = x2()
        x3 = x3()
        label1 = Label("branch one")
        label2 = Label("branch two")
        t1.set_downstream(label1)
        label1.set_downstream(x1)
        t2.set_downstream(label2)

        # or

        x1 = x1()
        x2 = x2()
        x3 = x3()
        t1.set_downstream(x1, edge_modifier=Label("branch one"))
