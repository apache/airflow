# Airflow Operators

Airflow Operators are modules that represent a single, ideally idempotent task. They are arbiters of the logic that executes when your DAG runs.

The Operators contained within this directory are core Airflow Operators from which others may inherit, including the modules distributed in provider packages. They are included by default in any Airflow implementation.
