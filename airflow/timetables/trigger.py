class CronTriggerTimetable(CronMixin, Timetable):
    """
    Timetable that triggers DAG runs according to a cron expression.

    This is different from ``CronDataIntervalTimetable``, where the cron
    expression specifies the *data interval* of a DAG run. With this timetable,
    the data intervals are specified independently from the cron expression.
    Also for the same reason, this timetable kicks off a DAG run immediately at
    the start of the period (similar to POSIX cron), instead of needing to wait
    for one data interval to pass.

    Don't pass ``@once`` in here; use ``OnceTimetable`` instead.

    :param cron: cron string that defines when to run
    :param timezone: Which timezone to use to interpret the cron string
    :param interval: timedelta that defines the data interval start. Default 0.

    *run_immediately* controls, if no *start_time* is given to the DAG, when
    the first run of the DAG should be scheduled. It has no effect if there
    already exist runs for this DAG.

    * If *True*, always run immediately the most recent possible DAG run.
    * If *False*, wait to run until the next scheduled time in the future.
    * If passed a ``timedelta``, will run the most recent possible DAG run
      if that run's ``data_interval_end`` is within timedelta of now.
    * If *None*, the timedelta is calculated as 10% of the time between the
      most recent past scheduled time and the next scheduled time. E.g. if
      running every hour, this would run the previous time if less than 6
      minutes had past since the previous run time, otherwise it would wait
      until the next hour.
