    Timetable that schedules DAG runs at specific listed datetimes.

    Suitable for predictable but truly irregular scheduling such as sporting events.

    :param event_dates: List of datetimes for the DAG to run at. Duplicates will be ignored. Must be finite
                        and of reasonable size as it will be loaded in its entirety.
    :param restrict_to_events: Whether manual runs should use the most recent event or
        the current time
    :param presorted: if True, event_dates will be assumed to be in ascending order. Provides modest
        performance improvement for larger lists of event_dates.
    :param description: A name for the timetable to display in the UI. Default None will be shown as
                        "X Events" where X is the len of event_dates
