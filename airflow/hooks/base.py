    """
    Interface that providers *can* implement to be discovered by ProvidersManager.

    It is not used by any of the Hooks, but simply methods and class fields described here are
    implemented by those Hooks. Each method is optional -- only implement the ones you need.

    The conn_name_attr, default_conn_name, conn_type should be implemented by those
    Hooks that want to be automatically mapped from the connection_type -> Hook when get_hook method
    is called with connection_type.

    Additionally hook_name should be set when you want the hook to have a custom name in the UI selection
    Name. If not specified, conn_name will be used.

    The "get_ui_field_behaviour" and "get_connection_form_widgets" are optional - override them if you want
    to customize the Connection Form screen. You can add extra widgets to parse your extra fields via the
    get_connection_form_widgets method as well as hide or relabel the fields or pre-fill
    them with placeholders via get_ui_field_behaviour method.

    Note that the "get_ui_field_behaviour" and "get_connection_form_widgets" need to be set by each class
    in the class hierarchy in order to apply widget customizations.

    For example, even if you want to use the fields from your parent class, you must explicitly
    have a method on *your* class:

    .. code-block:: python

        @classmethod
        def get_ui_field_behaviour(cls):
            return super().get_ui_field_behaviour()

    You also need to add the Hook class name to list 'hook_class_names' in provider.yaml in case you
    build an internal provider or to return it in dictionary returned by provider_info entrypoint in the
    package you prepare.

    You can see some examples in airflow/providers/jdbc/hooks/jdbc.py.

        If you have class hierarchy, usually the widgets needed by your class are already
        added by the base class, so there is no need to implement this method. It might
        actually result in warning in the logs if you try to add widgets that have already
        been added by the base class.

        Note that values of Dict should be of wtforms.Field type. It's not added here

        If you change conn_type in a derived class, you should also
        implement this method and return field customizations appropriate to your Hook. This
        is because the child hook will have usually different conn_type and the customizations
        are per connection type.
