Example Airflow DAG that runs speech synthesizing and stores output in Google Cloud Storage

This DAG relies on the following OS environment variables
* GCP_PROJECT_ID - Google Cloud Platform project for the Cloud SQL instance.
* GCP_SPEECH_TEST_BUCKET - Name of the bucket in which the output file should be stored.
