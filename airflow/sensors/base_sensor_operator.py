    Sensor operators are derived from this class and inherit these attributes.

    Sensor operators keep executing at a time interval and succeed when
    a criteria is met and fail if and when they time out.

    :param soft_fail: Set to true to mark the task as SKIPPED on failure
    :type soft_fail: bool
    :param poke_interval: Time in seconds that the job should wait in
        between each tries
    :type poke_interval: int
    :param timeout: Time, in seconds before the task times out and fails.
    :type timeout: int
    :param mode: How the sensor operates.
        Options are: ``{ poke | reschedule }``, default is ``poke``.
        When set to ``poke`` the sensor is taking up a worker slot for its
        whole execution time and sleeps between pokes. Use this mode if the
        expected runtime of the sensor is short or if a short poke interval
        is required. Note that the sensor will hold onto a worker slot and
        a pool slot for the duration of the sensor's runtime in this mode.
        When set to ``reschedule`` the sensor task frees the worker slot when
        the criteria is not yet met and it's rescheduled at a later time. Use
        this mode if the time before the criteria is met is expected to be
        quite long. The poke interval should be more than one minute to
        prevent too much load on the scheduler.
