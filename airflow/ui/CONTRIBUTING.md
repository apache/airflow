# Contributing to the UI

## Getting Started

1. Install `pnpm`. Check their [docs](https://pnpm.io/installation)

2. Start the project. ("watch" mode rebuilds the UI after each change, this is temporary until we get hot reloading working with Flask.)

```console
pnpm install
pnpm run build --watch
```

## Learn

If you're new to modern frontend development or parts of our stack, you may want to check out these resources to understand our codebase:

- Typescript is an extension of javascript to add type-checking to our app. Files ending in `.ts` or `.tsx` will be type-checked. Check out the [handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html) for an introduction or feel free to keep this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react) open while developing.

- React powers our entire app so it would be valuable to learn JSX, the html-in-js templates React utilizes. Files that contain JSX will end in `.tsx` instead of `.ts`. Check out their official [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) for a basic overview.

- Chakra-UI is our component library and theming system. You'll notice we have no traditional css nor html tags. This is all handled in Chakra with importing standard components like `<Box>` or `<Text>` that are styled globally in `src/theme.ts` file and then by passing styles as component props. Check out their [docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) to see all the included components and hooks.

- Testing is done with React Testing Library. We follow their idea of "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
  the more confidence they can give you." Keep their [cheatsheet](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet) open when writing tests

- We use Vite as our app framework for running a dev server and build commands. Check out their [docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) if you need to customize it.

- State management is handled with [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview). Context is used for App-level state that doesn't change often (authentication, dark/light mode). React Query handles all the state and side effects (loading, error, caching, etc) of async data from the API.

## Project Structure

- `/openapi` autogenerated types and queries based on the public REST API openapi spec. Do not manually edit. To regenerate use:

```console
pnpm run codegen
```

- `/src/assets` static assets for the UI
- `/src/components` shared components across the UI
- `/dist` build files
- TODO: build out project structure more
