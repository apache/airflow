        When those additional connections are returned to the pool, they are disconnected and discarded.
        It follows then that the total number of simultaneous connections the pool will allow
        is pool_size + max_overflow,
        and the total number of "sleeping" connections the pool will allow is pool_size.
        max_overflow can be set to ``-1`` to indicate no overflow limit;
        no limit will be placed on the total number of concurrent connections. Defaults to ``10``.

    session_backend:
      description: |
        The type of backend used to store web session data, can be `database` or `securecookie`. For the
        `database` backend, sessions are store in the database (in `session` table) and they can be
        managed there (for example when you reset password of the user, all sessions for that user are
        deleted). For the `securecookie` backend, sessions are stored in encrypted cookies on the client
        side. The `securecookie` mechanism is 'lighter' than database backend, but sessions are not deleted
        when you reset password of the user, which means that other than waiting for expiry time, the only
        way to invalidate all sessions for a user is to change secret_key and restart webserver (which
        also invalidates and logs out all other user's sessions).

        When you are using `database` backend, make sure to keep your database session table small
        by periodically running `airflow db clean --table session` command, especially if you have
        automated API calls that will create a new session for each call rather than reuse the sessions
        stored in browser cookies.

        updated and that SMTP/IMAP servers of yours have valid certificates that have corresponding public
        keys installed on your machines. You can switch it to "none" if you want to disable checking
        of the certificates, but it is not recommended as it allows MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks
        if your infrastructure is not sufficiently secured. It should only be set temporarily while you
        are fixing your certificate configuration. This can be typically done by upgrading to newer
        version of the operating system you run Airflow components on,by upgrading/refreshing proper
        certificates in the OS or by updating certificates for your mail servers.

        The scheduler reads dag files to extract the airflow modules that are going to be used,

        This flag can be set to False to disable this behavior in case an airflow module needs to be freshly
        imported each time (at the cost of increased DAG parsing time).

          recently modified DAGs first.
        * ``random_seeded_by_host``: Sort randomly across multiple Schedulers but with same order on the
          same host. This is useful when running with Scheduler in HA mode where each scheduler can
          parse different DAG files.
        * ``alphabetical``: Sort by filename
