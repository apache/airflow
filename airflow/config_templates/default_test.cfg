# This is the template for Airflow's unit test configuration. When Airflow runs
# unit tests, it looks for a configuration file at $AIRFLOW_HOME/unittests.cfg.
# If it doesn't exist, Airflow uses this template to generate it by replacing
# variables in curly braces with their global values from configuration.py.

# Users should not modify this file; they should customize the generated
# unittests.cfg instead.
