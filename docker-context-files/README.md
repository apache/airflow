This folder is part of the Docker context.

Most of other folders in Airflow are not part of the context in order to make the context smaller.

The Production [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) and the CI one [Dockerfile.ci](../Dockerfile.ci) copies
the [docker-context-files](.) folder to the image context - in case of production image it copies it to
the build segment, co content of the folder is available in the `/docker-context-file` folder inside
the build image. You can store constraint files and wheel
packages there that you want to install as PYPI packages and refer to those packages using
`--constraint-location` flag for constraints or by using `--install-from-local-files-when-building` flag.

By default, the content of this folder is .gitignored so that any binaries and files you put here are only
used for local builds and not committed to the repository.
