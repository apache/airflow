Task log templates are now read from the metadatabase instead of ``airflow.cfg``

Previously, a taskâ€™s log is dynamically rendered from the ``[core] log_filename_template`` and ``[elasticsearch] log_id_template`` config values at runtime. This resulted in unfortunate characteristics, e.g. it is impractical to modify the config value after an Airflow instance is running for a while, since all existing task logs have be saved under the previous format and cannot be found with the new config value.

A new ``log_template`` table is introduced to solve this problem. This table is synchronised with the aforementioned config values every time Airflow starts, and a new field ``log_template_id`` is added to every DAG run to point to the format used by tasks (\ ``NULL`` indicates the first ever entry for compatibility).
