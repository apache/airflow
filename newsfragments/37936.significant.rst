Time unit for ``scheduled_duration`` and ``queued_duration`` changed.

``scheduled_duration`` and ``queued_duration`` metrics are now emitted in milliseconds instead of seconds.
By convention all statsd metrics should be emitted in milliseconds, this is later expected in e.g. prometheus' statsd-exporter.
