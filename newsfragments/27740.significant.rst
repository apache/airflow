XCom API endpoint no longer supports ``deserialize`` option

For security reasons the XCom API no longer supports the ``deserialize`` option
to deserialize arbitrary XCom values in the webserver. Custom XCom backend can
implement their own ``orm_deserialize_value`` if required. However it is strongly
suggested to deserialize on the client side.
