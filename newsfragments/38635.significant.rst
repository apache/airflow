Support for AutoML operators and hooks has been limited only to AutoML Translation.

As of March 31, 2024, GCP has shut down most of the AutoML domains (AutoML Tables, AutoML Video Intelligence,
AutoML Vision, and AutoML Natural Language) in favor of equivalent domains of Vertex AI AutoML, and retained only AutoML
Translation. For that reason, AutoML operators and hooks that utilize obsolete APIs have been deprecated and will
raise ``AirflowException`` upon initialization. Using ``AutoMLTrainModelOperator`` for AutoML domains
other than translation will raise an exception as well.
