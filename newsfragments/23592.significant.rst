DAGS used in a context manager no longer need to be assigned to a module variable

Previously you had do assign a DAG to a module-level variable in order for Airflow to pick it up. For example this

.. code-block:: python

   with DAG(dag_id="example") as dag:
       ...


   @dag
   def dag_maker():
       ...


   dag2 = dag_maker()


can become

.. code-block:: python

   with DAG(dag_id="example"):
       ...


   @dag
   def dag_maker():
       ...


   dag_maker()

If you want to disable the behaviour for any reason then set ``auto_register=False`` on the dag::

.. code-block::

   # This dag will not be picked up by Airflow as it's not assigned to a variable
   with DAG(dag_id="example", auto_register=False):
      ...
