Removed legacy scheduling arguments on DAG

The ``schedule_interval`` and ``timetable`` arguments are removed from ``DAG``.

The ``schedule_interval`` _attribute_ has also been removed. In the API, a new
``timetable_summary`` field has been added to replace ``schedule_interval`` for
presentation purposes.
