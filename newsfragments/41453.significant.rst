Removed legacy scheduling arguments on DAG

The ``schedule_interval`` and ``timetable`` arguments are removed from ``DAG``.

The ``schedule_interval`` _attribute_ has also been removed. In the API, a new
``timetable_summary`` field has been added to replace ``schedule_interval`` for
presentation purposes.

Since the DAG object no longer has the ``schedule_interval`` attribute,
OpenLineage facets that contain the ``dag`` key produced on Airflow 3.0 or
later will also no longer contain the field.
