Dataset triggers now provide extra as DAG Run conf.

With data aware scheduling you can automate triggers between DAGs. passing context information was so far possible via
the name of the Dataset or by passing ``extra`` information to a downstream DAG. Retrieving the ``extra`` context
was only possible via the ``triggering_dataset_events`` context object and iterating over the details. With the new
version of Airflow the ``extra`` is merged into a dictionary and passed to the DAG directly as DAG Run conf so that
DAG params can directly be used.

See :ref:`Dataset Event Extra pushed as DAG Run Config <datasets:event-extra>` for more information.
