**Breaking Change**

Replaced Python's ``list`` with ``MutableSet`` for the property ``DAG.tags``.

At the constractur you still can use list,
you actually can use any data structure that implements the
``Collection`` interface.

The ``tags`` property of the ``DAG`` model would be of type
``MutableSet`` instead of ``list``,
as there are no actual duplicates at the tags.
