``kubernetes`` commands have been removed from the CLI

The ``kubernetes`` commands for ``generate_pod_yaml`` and ``cleanup_pods`` moved to the ``kubernetes`` provider package. If you were using these commands, you will need to install the ``apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes`` provider package.
These commands have been removed from core in Airflow 3 - in order to use them, you will need to install the provider package version 8.2.1+.
