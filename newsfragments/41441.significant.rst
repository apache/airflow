**Breaking Change**

The ``use_task_execution_day`` parameter has been removed from the ``BranchDayOfWeekOperator`` class.
This parameter was previously deprecated in favor of ``use_task_logical_date``.

If your code still uses ``use_task_execution_day``, you should update it to use ``use_task_logical_date``
instead to ensure compatibility with future Airflow versions.

Example update:

.. code-block:: python

    weekend_check = BranchDayOfWeekOperator(
        task_id="weekend_check",
        week_day={WeekDay.SATURDAY, WeekDay.SUNDAY},
        use_task_logical_date=True,
        follow_task_ids_if_true="weekend",
        follow_task_ids_if_false="workday",
    )
