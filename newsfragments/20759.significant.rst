Minimum kubernetes version bumped from ``3.0.0`` to ``21.7.0``

No change in behavior is expected.  This was necessary in order to take advantage of a `bugfix <https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base/commit/70b78cd8488068c014b6d762a0c8d358273865b4>`_ concerning refreshing of Kubernetes API tokens with EKS, which enabled the removal of some `workaround code <https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20759>`_.
