We've upgraded Flask Application Builder to a major version 4.*.

Flask Application Builder is one of the important components of Airflow Webserver, as
it uses a lof of dependencies that are essential to run the webserver and integrate it
in enterprise environments - especially authentication.

The FAB 4.* upgrades a number of dependencies to major releases, which upgrades them to versions
that have a number of security issues fixed. A lot of tests were performed to bring the dependencies
in a backwards-compatible way, however the dependencies themselves implement breaking changes in their
internals so it might be that some of those changes might impact the users in case they are using the
libraries for their onw purposes.

One important change that you likely will need to apply to Oauth configuration is to add
``server_metadata_url`` or ``jwks_uri`` and you can read about it more
in `this issue <https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/issues/1861>`_.
