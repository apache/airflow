Support for deprecated core imports removed

Support for importing classes etc from the following locations was deprecated at various times during Airflow 2s lifecycle, and has been removed:

- ``airflow.executors``
- ``airflow.hooks``
- ``airflow.macros``
- ``airflow.operators``
- ``airflow.sensors``

Instead, import from the right provider or more specific module instead.
For example, instead of ``from airflow.sensors import TimeDeltaSensor``, use ``from airflow.sensors.time_delta import TimeDeltaSensor``.
