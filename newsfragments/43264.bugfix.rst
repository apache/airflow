Fix(helm-chart): ``GITSYNC_X`` keys will no longer be mandatory when specifying ``dags.gitSync.credentialsSecret``. Since ``git-sync`` version ``v4`` requires the ``GIT_SYNC_X`` environment variables to be set, `34731 <https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34731>`_ added this functionality, but at the same time added the need to specify both ``GITSYNC_X`` and ``GIT_SYNC_X`` in the secret. This will now change and only the ``GIT_SYNC_X`` keys are used and required.
