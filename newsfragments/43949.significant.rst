The ``--clear-only`` option of ``airflow dags reserialize`` command is now removed.

The ``--clear-only`` option was added to clear the serialized DAGs without reserializing them.
This option is now removed as it is no longer needed. By default, the command only reserializes dags. If you want
to clear dags serialization history, you can use the ``--clear-history`` option.
