``conf.set()`` becomes case insensitive to match ``conf.get()`` behavior. Also, ``conf.get()`` will now break if used with non-string parameters.

``conf.set(section, key, value)`` used to be case sensitive, i.e. ``conf.set("SECTION", "KEY", value)``
and ``conf.set("section", "key", value)`` were stored as two distinct configurations.
This was inconsistent with the behavior of ``conf.get(section, key)``, which was always converting the section and key to lower case.

As a result, configuration options set with upper case characters in the section or key were unreachable.
That's why we are now converting section and key to lower case in ``conf.set`` too.

We also changed a bit the behavior of ``conf.get()``. It used to allow objects that are not strings in the section or key.
Doing this will now result in an exception. For instance, ``conf.get("section", 123)`` needs to be replaced with ``conf.get("section", "123")``.
