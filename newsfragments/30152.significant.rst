The ``cleanup()`` method in BaseTrigger is now defined as asynchronous (following async/await) pattern.

This is potentially a breaking change for any custom trigger implementations that override the ``cleanup()``
method and uses synchronous code, however using synchronous operations in cleanup was technically wrong,
because the method was executed in the main loop of the Triggerer and it was introducing unnecessary delays
impacting other triggers. The change is unlikely to affect any existing trigger implementations.
