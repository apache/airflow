**Breaking Change**

The ``get_conn_uri`` method has been removed from the ``AzureKeyVaultBackend`` class.
This method was previously deprecated in favor of ``get_conn_value``.

If your code still uses ``get_conn_uri``, you should update it to use ``get_conn_value``
instead to ensure compatibility with future Airflow versions.

Example update:

.. code-block:: python

    connection_by_conn_id = AzureKeyVaultBackend(
        vault_url="https://example-akv-resource-name.vault.azure.net/"
    ).get_conn_value(conn_id="conn_id")
