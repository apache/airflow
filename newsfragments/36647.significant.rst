Graphviz dependency is now an optional one, not required one.

The ``graphviz`` dependency has been problematic as Airflow required dependency - especially for
ARM-based installations. Graphviz packages require binary graphviz libraries - which is already a
limitation, but they also require to install graphviz Python bindings to be build and installed.
This does not work for older Linux installation but - more importantly - when you try to install
Graphviz libraries for Python 3.8, 3.9 for ARM M1 MacBooks, the packages fail to install because
Python bindings compilation for M1 can only work for Python 3.10+.

This is not a breaking change technically - the CLIs to render the DAGs is still there and IF you
already have graphviz installed, it will continue working as it did before. The only problem when it
does not work is where you do not have graphviz installed it will raise an error and inform that you need it.

Graphviz will remain to be installed for most users:

* the Airflow Image will still contain graphviz library, because
  it is added there as extra
* when previous version of Airflow has been installed already, then
  graphviz library is already installed there and Airflow will
  continue working as it did

The only change will be a new installation of new version of Airflow from the scratch, where graphviz will
need to be specified as extra or installed separately in order to enable DAG rendering option.
