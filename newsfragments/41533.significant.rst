**Breaking Change**

The ``load_connections`` parameter has been removed from the ``local_file_system``.
This parameter was previously deprecated in favor of ``load_connections_dict``.

If your code still uses ``load_connections``, you should update it to use ``load_connections_dict``
instead to ensure compatibility with future Airflow versions.

Example update:

.. code-block:: python

    connection_by_conn_id = local_filesystem.load_connections_dict(file_path="a.json")

The ``get_connections`` parameter has been removed from the ``LocalFilesystemBackend`` class.
This parameter was previously deprecated in favor of ``get_connection``.

If your code still uses ``get_connections``, you should update it to use ``get_connection``
instead to ensure compatibility with future Airflow versions.


Example update:

.. code-block:: python

    connection_by_conn_id = LocalFilesystemBackend().get_connection(conn_id="conn_id")
