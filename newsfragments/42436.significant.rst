Default ``.airflowignore`` syntax changed to ``glob``

The default value to the configuration ``[core] dag_ignore_file_syntax`` has
been changed to ``glob``, which better matches the ignore file behavior of many
popular tools.

To revert to the previous behavior, set the configuration to ``regexp``.
