Airflow 2.9.0 is the first release that officially supports Python 3.12.

There are a few caveats though:

* Pendulum2 does not support Python 3.12. For Python 3.12 you need to use
  `Pendulum 3 <https://pendulum.eustace.io/blog/announcing-pendulum-3-0-0.html>`_

* Minimum SQLAlchemy version supported when Pandas is installed for Python 3.12 is ``1.4.36`` released in
  April 2022. Airflow 2.9.0 increases the minimum supported version of SQLAlchemy to ``1.4.36`` for all
  Python versions.

Not all Providers support Python 3.12. At the initial release of Airflow 2.9.0 the following providers
are released without support for Python 3.12:

  * ``apache.beam`` - pending on `Implementing <https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29149>`_
  * ``apache.cassandra`` - pending on `Cassandra driver releasing binary driver with libev support <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-1378>`_
    or `Promoting asyncio reactor to be production ready in cassandra driver <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON-1375>`_
  * ``papermill`` - pending on Releasing Python 3.12 compatible papermill client version
    `including this merged issue <https://github.com/nteract/papermill/pull/771>`_
