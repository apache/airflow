Ensure teardown tasks are executed when DAG run is set to failed

Previously when a DAG run was manually set to "failed" or to "success" state the terminal state was set to all tasks.
But this was a gap for cases when setup- and teardown tasks were defined: If teardown was used to clean-up infrastructure
or other resources, they were also skipped and thus resources could stay allocated.

As of now when setup tasks had been executed before and the DAG is manually set to "failed" or "success" then teardown
tasks are executed. Teardown tasks are skipped  if the setup was also skipped.

As a side effect this means if the DAG contains teardown tasks, then the manual marking of DAG as "failed" or "success"
will need to keep the DAG in running state to ensure that teardown tasks will be scheduled. They would not be scheduled
if the DAG is diorectly set to "failed" or "success".
