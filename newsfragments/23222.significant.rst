The webserver.X_FRAME_ENABLED configuration works according to description now.

In Airflow 2.0.0 - 2.2.4 the webserver.X_FRAME_ENABLED parameter worked the opposite of its description,
setting the value to "true" caused "X-Frame-Options" header to "DENY" (not allowing Airflow to be used
in an IFrame). When you set it to "false", the header was not added, so Airflow could be embedded in an
IFrame. By default Airflow could not be embedded in an IFrame.

In Airflow 2.2.5 there was a bug introduced that made it impossible to disable Airflow to
work in IFrame. No matter what the configuration was set, it was possible to embed Airflow in an IFrame.

Airflow 2.3.0 restores the original meaning to the parameter. If you set it to "true" (default) Airflow
can be embedded in an IFrame (no header is added), but when you set it to "false" the header is added
and Airflow cannot be embedded in an IFrame.
