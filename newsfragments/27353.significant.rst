The helm chart is now using a newer version of bitnami/postgresql (from 10.5.3 to 12.1.9)

This version of the chart uses different variable names for setting usernames and passwords in the postgres database.
```postgresql.auth.enablePostgresUser``` is used to determine if the "postgres" admin account will be created.
```postgresql.auth.postgresPassword``` sets the password for the "postgres" user.
```postgresql.auth.username``` and ```postrgesql.auth.password``` are used to set credentials for a non-admin account if desired.
```postgresql.postgresqlUsername``` and ```postgresql.postresqlPassword```, which were used in the previous version of the chart, are no longer used.
Users will need to change these variable names in their values files if they are using the helm chart.
