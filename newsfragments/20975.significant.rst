XCom now define ``run_id`` instead of ``execution_date``

As a continuation to the TaskInstance-DagRun relation change started in Airflow 2.2, the ``execution_date`` columns on XCom has been removed from the database, and replaced by an `association proxy <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/extensions/associationproxy.html>`_ field at the ORM level. If you access Airflow’s metadatabase directly, you should rewrite the implementation to use the ``run_id`` column instead.

Note that Airflow’s metadatabase definition on both the database and ORM levels are considered implementation detail without strict backward compatibility guarantees.
