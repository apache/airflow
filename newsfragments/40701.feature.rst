Using Multiple Executors Concurrently: Previously known as hybrid executors, this new feature allows Airflow to use multiple executors concurrently. Dags, or even individual tasks, can be configured to use a specific executor that suits its needs best. A single DAG can contain tasks all using different executors. Please see the Airflow documentation for more details. Note: This feature is still experimental.
