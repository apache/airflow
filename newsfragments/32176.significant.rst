The ``xcomEntries`` API disables support for the ``deserialize`` flag by default

For security reasons, the ``/dags/*/dagRuns/*/taskInstances/*/xcomEntries/*``
API endpoint now disables the ``deserialize`` option to deserialize arbitrary
XCom values in the webserver. For backward compatibility, server admins may set
the ``[api] enable_xcom_deserialize_support`` config to *True* to enable the
flag and restore backward compatibility.

However, it is strongly advised to **not** enable the feature, and perform
deserialization at the client side instead.
