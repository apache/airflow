The default value for ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` is changed from 512 to 16.

This change is expected to make the Scheduler more responsive.

``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` needs to be lower than ``core.parallelism``.
If both were left to their default value previously, the effective default value of ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` was 32
(because it was capped at ``core.parallelism``).

To keep the behavior as close as possible to the old config, one can set ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query = 0``,
in which case it'll always use the value of ``core.parallelism``.
