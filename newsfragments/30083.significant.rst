Variable-interval cron timetables no longer account for DST transition

Given a cron expression resulting in an interval-based schedule, such as
``0 9-16 * * *``, job after a timezone change (e.g. entering or exiting daylight
saving time) used to be scheduled with an offset to the change in timezone. For
example, when operating in *America/New_York*, the above schedule would result
in a run at 10am on Monday morning after entering DST, instead of the previous
9am.

This was intentional to account for the change in timezone introduced in Airflow
2.2, but caused confusion to several use cases. The functionality is now
reverted to its pre-2.2 state, and timetables will now always run at the same
*clock time*, e.g. 9am in the above example.
