Timezone-traversing non-fixed cron timetables no longer accounts for timezone delta.

Given a cron expression which results in an `interval` based schedule instead of a `fixed` schedule such as `0 9-16 * * *`, the Monday after a timezone change (e.g. Daylight Savings Time) the first job would be one hour offset.
This was due to intentional code which accounted for timezone deltas, introduced after the switch to timetables (in `airflow>=2`).

As an example, if operating in the `America/New_York` timezone when entering daylight savings time, the above schedule would result in a `10am` execution on Monday morning, instead of the previous `9am`.

This functionality is now reverted, so timezone-aware timetables will now run at the same time, e.g. a `9am` timetable will always run at `9am` local time.
