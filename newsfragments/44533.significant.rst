During offline migration, ``DagRun.conf`` is cleared

.. Provide additional contextual information

The ``conf`` column is changing from pickle to json, thus, the values in that column cannot be migrated during offline migrations. If you want to retain ``conf`` values for existing DagRuns, you must do a normal, non-offline, migration.
