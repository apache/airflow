**Breaking Change**

The ``use_task_execution_day`` parameter has been removed from the ``DayOfWeekSensor`` class.
This parameter was previously deprecated in favor of ``use_task_logical_date``.

If your code still uses ``use_task_execution_day``, you should update it to use ``use_task_logical_date``
instead to ensure compatibility with future Airflow versions.

Example update:

.. code-block:: python

    sensor = DayOfWeekSensor(
        task_id="example",
        week_day="Tuesday",
        use_task_logical_date=True,
        dag=dag,
    )
