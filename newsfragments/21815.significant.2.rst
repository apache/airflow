The ``deps`` attribute on an operator class should be a class level attribute

To support operator-mapping (AIP 42), the ``deps`` attribute on operator class must be a set at the class level. This means that if a custom operator implements this as an instance-level variable, it will not be able to be used for operator-mapping. This does not affect existing code, but we highly recommend you to restructure the operator's dep logic in order to support the new feature.
