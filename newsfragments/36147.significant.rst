The ``allowed_deserialization_classes`` flag now follows a glob pattern.

For example if one wants to add the class ``airflow.tests.custom_class`` to the
``allowed_deserialization_classes`` list, it can be done by writing the full class
name (``airflow.tests.custom_class``) or a pattern such as the ones used in glob
search (e.g., ``airflow.*``, ``airflow.tests.*``).

If you currently use a custom regexp path make sure to rewrite it as a glob pattern.

Alternatively, if you still wish to match it as a regexp pattern, add it under the new
list ``allowed_deserialization_classes_regexp`` instead.
