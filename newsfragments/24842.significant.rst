Default DAG schedule changed to *None*

When a *schedule* parameter is not passed to the ``DAG`` constructor, Airflow
now defaults to never automatically schedule the DAG at all. The created DAG
can still be manually triggered, either by the user directly, or from another
DAG with ``TriggerDagRunOperator``.
