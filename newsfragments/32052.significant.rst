Disable default allowing the testing of connections in UI, API and CLI

The test connection functionality is disabled by default across Airflow UI,
API and CLI. The availability of the functionality can be controlled by the
``test_connection`` flag in the ``core`` section of the Airflow
configuration (``airflow.cfg``). It can also be controlled by the
environment variable ``AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION``.
The following values are accepted for this config param:
1. ``Disabled``: Disables the test connection functionality and
disables(greys out) the Test Connection button in the UI.
This is also the default value set in the Airflow configuration.
2. ``Enabled``: Enables the test connection functionality and
activates the Test Connection button in the UI.
3. ``Hidden``: Disables the test connection functionality and
hides the Test Connection button in UI.
