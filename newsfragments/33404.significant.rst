CronTriggerTimetable is now less aggressive when trying to skip a run

When setting ``catchup=False``, CronTriggerTimetable no longer skips a run if
the scheduler does not query the timetable immediately after the previous run
has been triggered.

This should not affect scheduling in most cases, but can change the behaviour if
a DAG is paused-unpaused to manually skip a run. Previously, the timetable (with
``catchup=False``) would only start a run after a DAG is unpaused, but with this
change, the scheduler would try to look at little bit back to schedule the
previous run that covers a part of the period when the DAG was paused. This
means you will need to keep a DAG paused longer (namely, for the entire cron
period to pass) to really skip a run.

Note that this is also the behaviour exhibited by various other cron-based
scheduling tools, such as anacron.
