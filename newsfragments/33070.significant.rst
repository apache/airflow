In case of SMTP SSL connection, the default context now uses "default" context

The "default" context is Python's ``default_ssl_contest`` instead of previously used "none". The
``default_ssl_context`` provides a balance between security and compatibility but in some cases,
when certificates are old, self-signed or misconfigured, it might not work. This can be configured
by setting "ssl_context" in "email" configuration of Airflow. Setting it to "none" brings back
the "none" setting that was used in Airflow 2.6 and before, but it is not recommended due to security
reasons ad this setting disables validation of certificates and allows MITM attacks.
