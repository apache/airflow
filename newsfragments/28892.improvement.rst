The configurations view now only displays the running configuration. Previously, the default configuration was displayed at the top but it wasn't obvious whether this default configuration was overridden or not. Subsequently, the non-documented endpoint ``/configuration?raw=true`` is deprecated and will be removed in Airflow 3.0. The HTTP response now returns an additional ``Deprecation`` header. The ``/config`` endpoint on the REST API is the standard way to fetch Airflow configuration programmatically.
