Pre-installed providers are minimized per default with Airflow 3.0.

Before Airflow 3.0 a set of providers were always pre-installed. We removed the pre-install of ftp, http and imap as they are not needed for all cases.

The following providers are pre-installed by default:

* common.compat
* common.io
* common.sql
* fab>=1.0.2
* smtp
* sqlite
* standard
