Clarifications of the external Health Check mechanism and using ``Job`` classes.

In the past SchedulerJob and other ``*Job`` classes are known to have been used to perform
external health checks for Airflow components. Those are, however, Airflow DB ORM related classes.
The DB models and database structure of Airflow are considered as internal implementation detail, following
`public interface <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/public-airflow-interface.html>`_).
Therefore, they should not be used for external health checks. Instead, you should use the
``airflow jobs check`` CLI command (introduced in Airflow 2.1) for that purpose.
