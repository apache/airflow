The ``conf`` variable, which provided access to the full Airflow configuration (``airflow.cfg``), has been deprecated and will be removed in Airflow 3 from the Task (Jinja2) template context for security and simplicity. If you need specific configuration values in your tasks, retrieve them explicitly in your DAG or task code using the ``airflow.configuration.conf`` module. For users retrieving the webserver URL (e.g., to include log links in task or callbacks), one of the most common use-case, use the ``ti.log_url`` property available in the ``TaskInstance`` context instead.
