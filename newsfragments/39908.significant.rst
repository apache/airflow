Publishing timer and timing metrics in seconds is now deprecated.

In Airflow 3.0, the ``timer_unit_consistency`` setting in the ``metrics`` section will be
enabled by default and setting itself will be removed. This will standardize all timer and timing metrics to
milliseconds across all metric loggers.

**Users Integrating with Datadog, OpenTelemetry, or other metric backends** should enable this setting. For users, using
``statsd``, this change will not affect you.

If you need backward compatibility, you can leave this setting disabled temporarily, but enabling
``timer_unit_consistency`` is encouraged to future-proof your metrics setup.
