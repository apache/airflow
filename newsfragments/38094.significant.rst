Prevent large string objects from being stored in the Rendered Template Fields

There's now a limit to the length of data that can be stored in the Rendered Template Fields.
The limit is set to 4096 characters. If the data exceeds this limit, it will be truncated. You can change this limit
by setting the ``[core]max_template_field_length`` configuration option in your airflow config.
