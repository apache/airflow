Operator Links interface changed to not run user code in Airflow Webserver

The Operator Extra links, which can be defined either via plugins or custom operators
now do not execute any user code in the Airflow Webserver, but instead push the "full"
links to XCom backend and the link is fetched from the XCom backend when viewing
task details, for example from grid view.

Example for users with custom links class:

.. code-block:: python

  @attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
  class CustomBaseIndexOpLink(BaseOperatorLink):
      """Custom Operator Link for Google BigQuery Console."""

      index: int = attr.ib()

      @property
      def name(self) -> str:
          return f"BigQuery Console #{self.index + 1}"

      @property
      def xcom_key(self) -> str:
          return f"bigquery_{self.index + 1}"

      def get_link(self, operator, *, ti_key):
          search_queries = XCom.get_one(
              task_id=ti_key.task_id, dag_id=ti_key.dag_id, run_id=ti_key.run_id, key="search_query"
          )
          return f"https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?j={search_query}"

The link has an xcom_key defined, which is how it will be stored in the XCOM backend, with key as xcom_key and
value as the entire link, this case: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?j=search
