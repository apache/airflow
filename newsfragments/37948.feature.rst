OpenTelemetry Traces for Apache Airflow. This new feature adds capability for Apache Airflow to emit 1) airflow system traces of scheduler, triggerer, executor, processor 2) DAG run traces for deployed DAG runs in OpenTelemetry format. Previously, only metrics were supported which emitted metrics in OpenTelemetry. This new feature will add richer data for users to use OpenTelemetry standard to emitt and send their trace data to OTLP compatible endpoints.
