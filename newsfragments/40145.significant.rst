``/logout`` endpoint in FAB Auth Manager is now CSRF protected

The ``/logout`` endpoint's method in FAB Auth Manager has been changed from ``GET`` to ``POST`` in all existing
AuthViews (``AuthDBView``, ``AuthLDAPView``, ``AuthOAuthView``, ``AuthOIDView``, ``AuthRemoteUserView``), and
now includes CSRF protection to enhance security and prevent unauthorized logouts.
