Removed Deprecated Python Version Identifiers from the ``airflow`` Module

Python version check constants, such as ``PY36``, ``PY37``, and others, have been removed from the ``airflow``
module. To check Python versions, please use the ``sys.version_info`` attribute directly instead.

Before:

.. code-block:: python

    from airflow import PY36

    if PY36:
        # perform some action
        ...

After:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys

    if sys.version_info >= (3, 6):
        # perform some action
        ...
