Removed deprecations in ``airflow.models.taskreschedule``.

Removed methods:

- ``query_for_task_instance()``
- ``find_for_task_instance()``

Note: there are no replacements. Direct access to DB is discouraged and will not be possible in Airflow 3 for tasks. The public REST API is the future way to interact with Airflow
