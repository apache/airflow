**Breaking Change**

The ``airflow.models.taskMixin.TaskMixin`` class has been removed. It was previously
deprecated in favor of the ``airflow.models.taskMixin.DependencyMixin`` class.
If your code relies on ``TaskMixin``, please update it to use ``DependencyMixin`` instead
to ensure compatibility with Airflow 3.0 and beyond.
