Remove requirement that custom connection UI fields be prefixed

Hooks can define custom connection fields for their connection type by implementing method ``get_connection_form_widgets``.  These custom fields are presented in the web UI as additional connection attributes, but internally they are stored in the connection ``extra`` dict.  For technical reasons, previously custom field when stored in ``extra`` had to be named with a prefix ``extra__<conn type>__<field name>``.  This had the consequence of making it more cumbersome to define connections outside of the UI, since the prefix is tougher to read and work with. With #22607, we make it so that you can now define custom fields such that they can be read from and stored in ``extra`` without the prefix.

To enable this, update the dict returned by the ``get_connection_form_widgets`` method to remove the prefix from the keys.  Internally, the providers manager will still use a prefix to ensure each custom field is globally unique, but the absence of a prefix in the returned widget dict will signal to the Web UI to read and store custom fields without the prefix.  Note that this is only a change to the Web UI behavior; when updating your hook in this way, you must make sure that when your *hook* reads the ``extra`` field, it will also check for the prefixed value for backward compatibility.
