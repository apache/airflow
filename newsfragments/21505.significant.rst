``airflow.models.base.Operator`` is removed

Previously, there was an empty class ``airflow.models.base.Operator`` for “type hinting”. This class was never really useful for anything (everything it did could be done better with ``airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator``\ ), and has been removed. If you are relying on the class’s existence, use ``BaseOperator`` (for concrete operators), ``airflow.models.abstractoperator.AbstractOperator`` (the base class of both ``BaseOperator`` and the AIP-42 ``MappedOperator``\ ), or ``airflow.models.operator.Operator`` (a union type ``BaseOperator | MappedOperator`` for type annotation).
