Dataset URIs are now validated on input

Datasets must use a URI that conform to rules laid down in AIP-60, and the value
will be automatically normalised when the DAG file is parsed. See
:doc:`documentation on Datasets </authoring-and-scheduling/datasets.rst>` for
a more detailed description on the rules.

You may need to change your Dataset identifiers if they look like a URI, but are
used in a less mainstream way, such as relying on the URI's auth section, or
have a case-sensitive protocol name.
