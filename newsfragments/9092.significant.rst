Default logging config has moved to a new module

The default logging config dict has moved from
``airflow.config_templates.airflow_local_settings.DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG`` to
``airflow.logging_config.DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG``.

Most users will not need to take any action as a result of this change. (If you have a custom logging config
which imports the base one you will receive a deprecation warning.)
