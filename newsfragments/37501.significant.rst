The audit_logs permissions have been updated for heightened security.

This was done under the policy that we do not want users like Viewer, Ops,
and other users apart from Admin to have access to audit_logs. The intention behind
this change is to restrict users with less permissions from viewing user details
like First Name, Email etc. from the audit_logs when they are not permitted to.

The impact of this change is that the existing users with non admin rights won't be able
to view or access the audit_logs, both from the Browse tab or from the DAG run.
