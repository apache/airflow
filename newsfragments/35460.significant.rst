Raw HTML code in DAG docs and DAG params descriptions is disabled by default

To ensure that no malicious javascript can be injected with DAG descriptions or trigger UI forms by DAG authors
a new parameter ``webserver.allow_raw_html_descriptions`` was added with default value of ``False``.
If you trust your DAG authors code and want to allow using raw HTML in DAG descriptions and params, you can restore the previous
behavior by setting the configuration value to ``True``.

To ensure Airflow is secure by default, the raw HTML support in trigger UI has been super-seeded by markdown support via
the ``description_md`` attribute. If you have been using ``description_html`` please migrate to ``description_md``.
The ``custom_html_form`` is now deprecated.
