Per default raw HTML code in DAG docs and DAG params descriptions is disabled with 2.8.0.

To ensure that no malicious javascript can be injected with DAG descriptions or trigger UI forms by DAG authors
a new parameter ``webserver.allow_html_in_dag_docs`` was added with default value of ``False``.
If you trust your DAG authors code and want to allow using raw HTML in DAG descriptions and params and restore the previous
behavior you must set the configuration value to ``True``.

To ensure Airflow is secure by default, the raw HTML support in trigger UI has been super-seeded by markdown support via
the ``description_md`` attribute. If you have been using ``description_html`` please migrate to ``description_md``.
The ``custom_html_form`` is now deprecated and will be replaced by a more secure feature in a future release.
