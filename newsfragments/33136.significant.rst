The "airflow db init", "airflow db upgrade" commands and "[database] load_default_connections" configuration options are deprecated.

Instead, you should use "airflow db migrate" command to create or upgrade database. This command will not create default connections.
In order to create default connections you need to run "airflow connections create-default-connections" explicitly,
after running "airflow db migrate".
