Default connections no longer created by ``airflow db reset``

When default connection creation was removed from the ``airflow db migrate`` command in in 2.7,
``airflow db reset`` was missed and still used the deprecated configuration option
``[database] load_default_connections``. ``airflow db reset`` no longer does, so after a DB reset you must call
``airflow connections create-default-connections`` explicitly if you'd like the default connections to be created.
