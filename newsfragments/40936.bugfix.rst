Fix: ``on_success_callback`` will no longer execute if a task is skipped. Previously, this callback was triggered even when the task was skipped, which could lead to unintended behavior or inconsistencies in downstream processes. This is a breaking change because workflows that rely on ``on_success_callback`` running for skipped tasks will need to be updated. Consider updating your DAGs to handle cases where the callback is not invoked due to task skipping.
