Provider configuration fallbacks removed from core

Around ~2.7, we moved provider config from core into the providers themselves.
However, if providers that were released before that change was used on 2.7+,
there could be failures because the config wouldn't be in those providers!
So, we added a fallback for all of the configs that were moved. These fallbacks
have now been removed. You must use providers that contain their own config.

TODO: It's unlikely this will be the change that sets the "lowest" min provider version
for compatibility with Airflow 3. But, it is possible, and if it is we will need to
then determine what those versions are.

Note: This changes doesn't really fix in any of the following "types", but I've marked
dependency change so there is something checked.
