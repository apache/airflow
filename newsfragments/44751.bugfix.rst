``TriggerRule.ALWAYS`` cannot be utilized within a task-generated mapping, either in bare tasks (fixed in this PR) or mapped task groups (fixed in PR #44368). The issue with doing so, is that the task is immediately executed without waiting for the upstreams's mapping results, which certainly leads to failure of the task. This fix avoids it by raising an exception when it is detected during DAG parsing.
