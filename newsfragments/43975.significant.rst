Timer and timing metrics are now standardized to milliseconds

In Airflow 3.0, the ``timer_unit_consistency`` setting in the ``metrics`` section is removed as it is now the default behaviour.
This is done to standardize all timer and timing metrics to milliseconds across all metric loggers.

Airflow 2.11 introduced the ``timer_unit_consistency`` setting in the ``metrics`` section of the configuration file. The
default value was ``False`` which meant that the timer and timing metrics were logged in seconds. This was done to maintain
backwards compatibility with the previous versions of Airflow.
