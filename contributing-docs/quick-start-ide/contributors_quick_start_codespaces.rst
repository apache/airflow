Setup and develop using GitHub Codespaces
#########################################

1. Goto |airflow_github| and fork the project.

   .. |airflow_github| raw:: html

     <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/" target="_blank">https://github.com/apache/airflow/</a>

   .. raw:: html

     <div align="center" style="padding-bottom:10px">
       <img src="images/quick_start/airflow_fork.png"
            alt="Forking Apache Airflow project">
     </div>

2. Follow `Codespaces Quickstart <https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart>`_ to start
   a new codespace.

3. Once the codespace starts your terminal should be already in ``Breeze`` environment and you should
   be able to edit and run the tests in VS Code interface.

4. You can use `Quick start quide for Visual Studio Code <contributors_quick_start_vscode.rst>`_ for details
   as Codespaces use Visual Studio Code as interface.


Follow the `Quick start <03_contributors_quick_start.rst>`_ for typical development tasks.
