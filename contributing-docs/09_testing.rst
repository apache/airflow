Airflow Test Infrastructure
===========================

* `Unit tests <testing/unit_tests.rst>`__ are Python tests that do not require any additional integrations.
  Unit tests are available both in the `Breeze environment <../dev/breeze/doc/README.rst>`__
  and `local virtualenv <07_local_virtualenv.rst>`__. More about unit tests.

* `Integration tests <testing/integration_tests.rst>`__ are available in the
  `Breeze environment <../dev/breeze/doc/README.rst>`__ that is also used for Airflow CI tests.
  Integration tests are special tests that require additional services running, such as Postgres,
  MySQL, Kerberos, etc.

* `Docker Compose tests <testing/docker_compose_tests.rst>`__ are tests we run to check if our quick
  start docker-compose works.

* `Kubernetes tests <testing/k8s_tests.rst>`__ are tests we run to check if our Kubernetes
  deployment and Kubernetes Pod Operator works.

* `Helm unit tests <testing/helm_unit_tests.rst>`__ are tests we run to verify if Helm Chart is
  rendered correctly for various configuration parameters.

* `System tests <testing/system_tests.rst>`__ are automatic tests that use external systems like
  Google Cloud and AWS. These tests are intended for an end-to-end DAG execution.

You can also run other kind of tests when you are developing airflow packages:

* `Testing packages <testing/testing_packages.rst>`__ is a document that describes how to
  manually build and test pre-release candidate packages of airflow and providers.

* `DAG testing <testing/dag_testing.rst>`__ is a document that describes how to test DAGs in a local environment
  with ``DebugExecutor``. Note, that this is a legacy method - you can now use dag.test() method to test DAGs.

------

You can learn how to `build documentation <../docs/README.rst>`__ as you will likely need to update
documentation as part of your PR.

You can also learn about `working with git <10_working_with_git.rst>`__ as you will need to understand how
git branching works and how to rebase your PR.
