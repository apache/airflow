Execution API Versioning
========================

Airflow's Task Execution API uses `Cadwyn <https://github.com/zmievsa/cadwyn>`_ for API versioning with CalVer.
This allows us to maintain backward compatibility while evolving the API over time.

Why?
----

Airflow components (e.g., workers, API servers) could be deployed independently. This can lead
to version mismatchesâ€”for example, a worker using Task SDK 1.0.1 (requiring Airflow >=3.0.1) while the
API server is still on 3.0.0. Without versioning, such mismatches can cause runtime failures or subtle bugs.
A strict versioning model allows older clients to continue working with newer servers, enabling safe, incremental upgrades.

Versioning Principles
---------------------

1. Any change to the API schema or behavior that affects existing clients requires a new version.
2. All versions are maintained in the codebase
3. Migrations encapsulate all schema changes.
4. Core code logic remains version-agnostic.

Version Changes
---------------

When making changes to the Execution API, you must:

1. Add a new migration module (e.g., ``v2025_04_28.py``). Pick a likely date for when the Airflow version
   will be released.

   - Use the ``vYYYY_MM_DD`` format.
   - New migrations can be added to an existing unreleased version; not every migration needs a new version.
   - For unreleased versions, pick a likely date for when it will be released.
   - The version number should be unique and not conflict with any existing versions.
2. Document the changes in the migration.
3. Update tests to cover both old and new versions.
4. Ensure backward compatibility wherever possible.

Example Version Migration
-------------------------

Here's an example of how to add a new version migration that adds a new field ``consumed_asset_events`` to the
``DagRun`` model.

.. code-block:: python

    from cadwyn import ResponseInfo, VersionChange, convert_response_to_previous_version_for, schema

    from airflow.api_fastapi.execution_api.datamodels.taskinstance import DagRun, TIRunContext


    class AddConsumedAssetEventsField(VersionChange):
        """Add the `consumed_asset_events` to DagRun model."""

        description = __doc__

        instructions_to_migrate_to_previous_version = (schema(DagRun).field("consumed_asset_events").didnt_exist,)

        @convert_response_to_previous_version_for(TIRunContext)  # type: ignore
        def remove_consumed_asset_events(response: ResponseInfo):  # type: ignore
            response.body["dag_run"].pop("consumed_asset_events")

Directory Structure
-------------------

The Execution API versioning code is organized as follows:

- ``airflow-core/src/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/versions/`` - Contains version migrations
- ``airflow-core/src/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/versions/head/`` - Contains the latest version models
- ``airflow-core/src/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/versions/v2025_04_28/`` - Contains version-specific models and migrations
- ``airflow-core/tests/unit/api_fastapi/execution_api/versions/head`` - Contains tests for the latest version
- ``airflow-core/tests/unit/api_fastapi/execution_api/versions/v2025_04_28`` - Contains tests for the version-specific models
