Contributors' guide
===================

Contributions are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps,
and credit will always be given.

This index of linked documents aims to explain the subject of contributions if you have not contributed to
any Open Source project, but it will also help people who have contributed to other projects learn about the
rules of that community.

New Contributor
---------------

If you are a new contributor, please follow the `Contributors Quick Start <03_contributors_quick_start.rst>`__
guide to get a gentle step-by-step introduction to setting up the development environment and making your
first contribution.

If you are new to the project, you might need some help in understanding how the dynamics
of the community works and you might need to get some mentorship from other members of the
community - mostly Airflow committers (maintainers). Mentoring new members of the community is part of
maintainers job so do not be afraid of asking them to help you. You can do it
via comments in your PR, asking on a devlist or via Slack. For your convenience,
we have a dedicated ``#development-first-pr-support`` Slack channel where you can ask any questions
about making your first Pull Request (PR) contribution to the Airflow codebase - it's a safe space
where it is expected that people asking questions do not know a lot Airflow (yet!).
If you need help with Airflow see the Slack channel #troubleshooting.

To check on how mentoring works for the projects under Apache Software Foundation's
`Apache Community Development - Mentoring <https://community.apache.org/mentoring/>`_.

* `Provider packages <11_provider_packages.rst>`__ describes the provider packages and how they
  are used in Airflow.


Deep dive into specific topics
------------------------------

Once you can also dive deeper into specific areas that are important for contributing to Airflow:

* `Airflow dependencies and extras <12_airflow_dependencies_and_extras.rst>`__ describes
  the dependencies - both required and optional (extras) used in Airflow.
