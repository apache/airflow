Your First Airflow Pull Request â€” 5-Minute Guide
===============================================

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Purpose
-------
This page walks **new contributors** through opening their first
Apache Airflow pull request (PR) in about five minutes.  We present *one*
local option (Breeze) and *one* fully-hosted option (GitHub Codespaces).
Everything else lives in the advanced guides.

Prerequisites
-------------
* GitHub account
* `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui>`_ `apache/airflow <https://github.com/apache/airflow>`__
* `Basic Git <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git>`__ (**only** required for the Breeze path below)

For Breeze (local development):
* `Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>`__
* `Podman <https://podman.io/>`__, a drop-in, license-friendly replacement for Docker Desktop
* `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__
* `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`__, which is a fast, reliable package manager that you'll use to install other developer tools to make contributing to Airflow easier.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
* `Prek <https://github.com/j178/prek>`__, which runs Airflow's required code-quality checks (formatting, linting, and bug-spotting) before you commit, helping save contributors and committers time during the pull request process.

.. code-block:: bash

    uv tool install prek
    prek install -f
* 4GB RAM, 40GB disk space, and at least 2 CPU cores

.. note::
   Docker **or Podman** installation varies by OS. See the `full guide <03b_contributors_quick_start_seasoned_developers.html#local-machine-development>`_ for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows instructions.

Option A â€“ Breeze on Your Laptop
--------------------------------
1.  **Clone your fork and install Breeze**

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/<you>/airflow.git
    cd airflow
    uv tool install -e ./dev/breeze

2.  **Start the development container** (first run builds the image)

.. code-block:: bash

    breeze start-airflow

The command starts a shell and launches multiple terminals using tmux
and launches all Airflow necessary components in those terminals. To know more about tmux commands,
check out this cheat sheet: https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/. To exit breeze, type ``start-airflow`` in any
of the tmux panes and hit Enter.

3.  **Make a tiny change** â€“ e.g. fix a typo in docs

4.  **Run local checks**

.. code-block:: bash

    prek --all-files

5.  **Commit & push**

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b docs-typo
    git commit -am "fix typo in README"
    git push -u origin docs-typo

6.  **Open the PR** â€“ GitHub shows a "Compare & pull request" button.

*Syncing your branch*

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main && git push --force-with-lease

Option B â€“ One-Click GitHub Codespaces
-------------------------------------
1. On **your fork**, click *Code â†’ Codespaces â†’ New codespace*.
2. Wait for the VS Code web IDE to appear.  A terminal opens automatically.
3. Install Breeze and start the development container

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv tool install prek
    prek install -f
    uv tool install -e ./dev/breeze
    breeze start-airflow

4. Edit a file in the editor, save, and commit via the Source Control
   sidebar.  Push when prompted.
5. Press **Create pull request** when GitHub offers.

Review & Merge
--------------
Respond to reviewer comments, push updates (same commands as above).  Once
CI is green and reviews are âœ…, a committer will merge.  ðŸŽ‰
