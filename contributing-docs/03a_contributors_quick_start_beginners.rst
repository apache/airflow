Your First Airflow Pull Request â€” 5-Minute Guide
===============================================

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Purpose
-------
This page walks **new contributors** through opening their first
Apache Airflow pull request (PR) in about five minutes.  We present *one*
local option (Breeze) and *one* fully-hosted option (GitHub Codespaces).
Everything else lives in the advanced guides.

Prerequisites
-------------
* GitHub account
* Fork `apache/airflow <https://github.com/apache/airflow>`__
* Basic Git installed **only** for the Breeze path below

For Breeze (local development):
* Docker Community Edition
* Docker Compose
* UV for Python tool management::

    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
* 4GB RAM, 40GB disk space, and at least 2 CPU cores

.. note::
   Docker installation varies by OS. See the `full guide <03b_contributors_quick_start_seasoned_developers.html#local-machine-development>`_ for Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows instructions.

Option A â€“ Breeze on Your Laptop
--------------------------------
1.  **Clone your fork and install Breeze**::

        git clone https://github.com/<you>/airflow.git
        cd airflow
        uv tool install -e ./dev/breeze

2.  **Start the development container** (first run builds the image)::

        breeze start-airflow

3.  **Make a tiny change** â€“ e.g. fix a typo in docs::

        sed -i '' 's/Airflow/AirflowÂ®/' contributing-docs/README.rst

4.  **Run local checks**::

        prek --all-files

5.  **Commit & push**::

        git checkout -b docs-typo
        git commit -am "fix typo in README"
        git push -u origin docs-typo

6.  **Open the PR** â€“ GitHub shows a "Compare & pull request" button.

*Syncing your branch*::

    git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main && git push --force-with-lease

Option B â€“ One-Click GitHub Codespaces
-------------------------------------
1. On **your fork**, click *Code â†’ Codespaces â†’ New codespace*.
2. Wait for the VS Code web IDE to appear.  A terminal opens automatically.
3. If you want to test an Airflow functionality, best way is to install Breeze within Codespaces and start the development container::

        breeze start-airflow

4. Edit a file in the editor, save, and commit via the Source Control
   sidebar.  Push when prompted.
5. Press **Create pull request** when GitHub offers.

Review & Merge
--------------
Respond to reviewer comments, push updates (same commands as above).  Once
CI is green and reviews are âœ…, a committer will merge.  ðŸŽ‰
