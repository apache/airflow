Airflow Python API Client Tests
===============================

This document describes how to run tests for the Airflow Python API client.

Running Python API Client Tests with Breeze
-------------------------------------------

The Python API client tests are run in the Breeze environment. The tests are run in the same way as the other tests in Breeze.

The way the tests work:

1. The Airflow Python API client package is first built into a wheel file and placed in the dist folder.
2. The ``breeze testing python-api-client-tests`` command is used to initiate the tests.
3. This command installs the package from the dist folder.
4. Example DAGs are then parsed and executed to validate the Python API client.
5. The webserver is started with the credentials admin/admin, and tests are run against the webserver.

If you have python client repository not cloned, you can clone it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python.git

To build the package, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    breeze release-management prepare-python-client --package-format both
          --version-suffix-for-pypi dev0 --python-client-repo ./airflow-client-python
