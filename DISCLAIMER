Apache Airflow is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability
of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
