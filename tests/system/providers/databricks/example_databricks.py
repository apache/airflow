"""
This is an example DAG which uses the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator.
In this example, we create two tasks which execute sequentially.
The first task is to run a notebook at the workspace path "/test"
and the second task is to run a JAR uploaded to DBFS. Both,
tasks use new clusters.

Because we have set a downstream dependency on the notebook task,
the spark jar task will NOT run until the notebook task completes
successfully.

The definition of a successful run is if the run has a result_state of "SUCCESS".
For more information about the state of a run refer to
https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runstate
